            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What ſayeſt thou (O man) that thou haſt no leiſure by reaſon of thy worldly buſineſſes to reade the Word of God, the more thy diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, the more need haſt thou to reade, that amidſt the toſsings of theſe tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous waues, thou mayſt enioy the perpetuall comforts and directions of the Scriptures. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond,<note place="margin">Theodoſ. 2.</note> though his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions could not but bee great through the amplitude of his Dominions, yet ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much time in his priuate Cloſet to the Word of God, that hee wrote the new Teſtament ouer with his owne hand: and <hi>Alphonſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alphonſus.</note> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> is ſaid to haue read the Bible with the ordinary gloſſe fourteene times ouer.
<pb facs="tcp:12860:6"/>Which things J mention not (moſt Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soueraigne) but onely to adde fuell to your fire and oyle vnto your flame: that the zeale which your Maieſty is well knowne to haue vnto the Word of God and to the truth therein ſet forth, may bee yet increaſed till it commeth to be doubled, as the ſpirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> was vpon <hi>Eliſhah.</hi> For what ſeruice is there, that wee, the Miniſters of Chriſts Goſpell can doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this of ſeeking the through Sanctification of the Lords Anointed ouer vs, and of poliſhing the rich Diamonds of grace vpon his Crowne, that they be more and more reſplendent and ſhining? The bent of our Prayers both publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate is daily this way, and therefore let my Lord, the King, pardon the zeale of his ſeruants, if when they can get any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, their exhortations bend this way alſo. We reade of Gods bleſsings vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:12860:6"/>people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> vnder <hi>Dauid, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and generally how in the dayes of all the godly Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours that haue beene, the Graces ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in them haue beene ſo acceptable, as that the Lord hath delighted to doe good to the whole Kingdome for their ſakes. Your Maieſty is the very breath of our noſthrils and the light of our eyes, that great Tree mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> vnder which we your Subiects, as beaſts and birds doe ſhroud our ſelues and make our neſts, being alone worth <hi>10000.</hi> of vs. Jt is therefore the height of our ambition in our inward deſires and outward endeuours, that your Maieſty may be vpright hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and valiant as <hi>Dauid,</hi> wiſe as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and of ardent zeale like vnto <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi> And to this end doe we preſſe, as into the Court of Heauen by our Prayers, ſo into your Maieſties Court with Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb facs="tcp:12860:7"/>Treatiſes, Diſcourſes, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, not paſsing for any toile and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, any carping and cauilling of cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Critikes, or any enmity of Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, ſo that what we doe may be cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to him, to behold whoſe vertues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with his yeeres our eyes and hearts are all fixed. The times are dangerous, and the enemies of the truth haue of late yeeres greatly preuailed, and ſtill they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite their forces like <hi>Gebal,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and theſe of <hi>Tyre:</hi> but God, who is the patron of the truth, hath ſhewed that he will put an end to theſe troubles, and one day theſe incendiaries of warres ſhall haue a battell, wherein they ſhall fight their laſt, euen in <hi>Harmaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Jn the meane ſeaſon yet, were J a <hi>Daniel,</hi> though to ſpeake before ſo great a King as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or a <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> though to ſpeake before a King as
<pb facs="tcp:12860:7"/>renowmed as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> J would not only preſent the explication of theſe darke my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, but giue counſell alſo what is to be done by your Royall Maieſtie, who by the Grace of God are the moſt potent and chiefe Defender of the truth at this day in Chriſtendome. But J am a childe in vnderſtanding, neither haue J the ſpirit to be able to giue counſell in State affaires. Onely J pray God, from whom is the ſpirit of ſuch deepe vnderſtanding, to inſpire your Maieſties noble Councellors, that they may giue the Counſell, and your Royall Heart, that you may accept of it, whether it tendeth to the animaduerſion againſt ſinne and all notorious ſinfull perſons, and to the diſcountenancing of them, to the embracing with loue and fauour of the moſt godly and zealous for the truth, or to a more ſtrict proceeding for the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, if not for the rooting out of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:12860:8"/>whoſe cauſe is common with the enemies that threaten danger and ruine to vs all. And touching my preſent worke, my humble ſuit vnto your Maieſty is, that you would accept of it, at your vacant times peruſe it, and ſuffer it to paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Royall Patronage, though not for his ſake that publiſheth it, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed vnworthy of ſuch a fauour, yet for the ſakes of thoſe Worthies, with whom hee comes accompanied, euen almoſt all the moſt famous Inſtruments that God hath euer vſed to giue light to theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities. My deſire and firſt purpoſe was to haue preſented together to your Maieſties view the whole new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, expounded and handled in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in all the paſſages that moſt need ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, a Worke of that ſort that I know not any yet that hath laboured in it, but as I conceiue ſuch as may be of great vſe
<pb facs="tcp:12860:8"/>and benefit to all that are ſtudious of the holy Scriptures, and herein by the Grace of God J haue proceeded ſo farre that I want not much to the perfecting thereof. But for ſo much as partly through my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily infirmities, and partly through my many weekly anocaments in my paſtorall charge, I muſt be a long time in doing à little in this, wherein ſo many Authors muſt be peruſed; I haue made bold to come with this Modell that I haue ready till the whole ſhall be finiſhed, which if it may be acceptable, ſhall be altogether then at your Maieſties ſeruice. Jn the meane ſeaſon, crauing pardon for this my preſumption, I doe out of a true and moſt affectionate deſire, commend your Maieſtie to the Grace, Bleſsing, and Protection of the Higheſt, beſeeching him to make you as happy as any of your Progenitors in a truly Religious and fruitfull Queene, wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:12860:9"/>Counſellors, learned and holy Miniſters, loyall and obedient Commons, and in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious proceedings for the defence of the diſtreſſed Goſpell, and after this life en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (to which may it long be) in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of an vncorruptible Crowne of glory.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, it is about foure yeeres ſince I promiſed, as my firſt worke done in this kinde ſhould be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to put out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of like nature vpon other myſticall and darke places of the holy Scriptures. Now I cannot but acknowledge my ſelfe herein a debter vnto thee for thy good acceptation, both of that, and of ſome other Bookes of mine alſo, and therefore as my weakneſſe would giue me leaue, and the manifold diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſickneſſes, remouings, worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances, and miniſteriall Offices lying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:12860:10"/>me permit, I haue prepared another part of the intended Treaſury which thou here ſeeſt. Not as haply is expected, vpon the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> which are next in order, but vpon the ſeuen ſmaller and more neglected Epiſtles and the Reuelation. For I obſerued that faith without relying vpon workes for iuſtification, is not ſo needfull to bee preſſed now adaies, which is a chiefe thing inſiſted vpon in the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but true loue and works flowing here-from, together with an holy and vnblamable life, to ſtirre vp vnto which, if we ſpeake of the firſt, the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> are excellent; of the ſecond, the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iames;</hi> and if of the third, thoſe of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> Againe, there are few that haue written vpon theſe Epiſtles in compariſon of the other, and therefore for a ſupply of this defect, I thought it would be more acceptable, ſeeing I cannot doe all together, to doe ſome thing firſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Laſtly, becauſe of all the Bookes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Reuelation is leaſt vnderſtood, and therefore is leaſt read and meditated vpon, and yet moſt neceſſary comforts in theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous times are to bee fetchted here-from, as ſingularly pointing at them, and a finall
<pb facs="tcp:12860:10"/>deliuerance of the Church of God from all her troubles, my ſpeciall aime in anticipating the proper time of it hath beene, that thou mayeſt not be longer left without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this common place of comfort, but be ſtayed and ſtabliſhed in an aſſured expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ioyfull and bleſſed end, through the certaine and ſpeedy downfall of the Romiſh Antichriſt, and the vniuerſall preuailing of the truth that then ſhall be, and the great triumphs that ſhall be made amongſt the faithfull in all places therefore. In this Worke I haue not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted barely to explicate the difficulties of the Texts vndertaken, laying onely together what I finde in my Authors, and briefly concluding vpon my Expoſition imbraced. But in the ſeuen Catholike Epiſtles which are handled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the method of my former worke, I haue ſupplyed, which was there wanting: Firſt, a Preface to each Epiſtle. Secondly, an Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of each Chapter. Thirdly, choice Latine ſentences oppoſed in the margine. Fourthly, a confutation of thoſe Expoſitions which I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not. Fiftly, a paraphraſticall Expoſition of the verſes comming betweene Text and Text, wherein there is ſome, but leſſe obſcurity.
<pb facs="tcp:12860:11"/>Sixtly, ſome ſhort Annotations at the end of euery Text. Touching the Reuelation, becauſe after the three former Chapters it is all moſt obſcure:<note place="margin">Hicronim. Epiſt. ad Paulim.</note> for according to <hi>Ierome, Quot verba ſunt tot ſunt myſteria,</hi> there are as many myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as words; I haue therefore altered my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before vſed, handling it thorowout by Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſometime did many parts of the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> And becauſe, if I ſhould here haue brought in my Authors ſpeaking, the worke would haue growne too great, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries to bee expounded being ſo many, and the Expoſitors ſo many, I haue ſpared this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and onely ſhewed the diuerſity of their expoſitions, ſo proceeding to examine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine about euery queſtion. And whereas in my determinations I haue ſometimes gone from ſuch Authors, as many of good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and zeale doe approue of, and ſometimes from all, venting mien owne <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">Gorran.</note> though <hi>Anſelme</hi> be for this vſefull, becauſe hee hath collected his expoſitions out of diuers workes of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and fitted them ſo to the Epiſtles which he hath written vpon, that hee hath thereout made a iuſt Comment vpon them.

But if there be no ſuch certainty, then that which the circumſtance of the place hindreth not, and which agreeth with ſound faith, but if from the circumſtance of the place it cannot be diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then that onely which the ſacred Faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth. For though the meaning of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:12860:12"/>be vncertaine, yet it is not vnprofitable to frame an Expoſition agreeable to ſound faith. For mine owne part, I am ſo conſcious to my ſelfe of mine owne weakneſſe and want of iudgement, that howſoeuer, that which I haue written ſeemeth to mee moſt probable of all other Expoſitions in theſe darke and doubtfull paſſages, yet I force it not vpon any man, but now that I haue aduentured it to the publike view, I doe in all humility ſubmit all to the iudgement of the learned, crauing (for the good ſucceſſe of that which is here done, and for the ſeaſonable and moſt ſufficient perfecting of that which is further to bee done in this kinde) the helpe of thy moſt feruent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayers.</p>

            <head>THE CATHOLIKE EPISTLE OF THE Apoſtle IAMES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epiſtle together with the ſix following, haue gone vnder the name of Catholike Epiſtles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Greekes, and of Canonicall amongſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines a long time; but vpon what reaſon it is vncertaine, ſaith <hi>Pareus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pareus in Iac. Epiſt. Lyra, Oecum. Gorran.</note> The reaſon which is yeelded by <hi>Lyra, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius</hi> and <hi>Gorran,</hi> that they haue the name of Catholike from the vniuerſality of thoſe, to whom they are directed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all the Iewes diſperſed into all countries, or to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people in all Countries of the world; whereas Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles are directed to particular Countries, ſeemeth vnto him to be no good reaſon, becauſe ſo the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes being written to all the Iewes whereſoeuer, ſhould haue beene intituled Catholike likewiſe; and the two latter Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> being to particular perſons, could not by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12860:17"/>this reaſon be called Catholike. And touching the name cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, it is more diſliked by <hi>Beza</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">Beza.</note> becauſe not theſe ſeuen Epiſtles, but all the reſt are canonicall alike. But the reaſon of the name Catholike ſeemeth to me to bee good, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the exceptions alledged: for the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes haply was ſent to Ieruſalem, the proper place of the Hebrewes, where they ſtill offered their Sacrifices, as ſeemeth by the Argument of the Epiſtle; and therefore might not ſo well be intituled Catholike, but onely The Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes; as that to the Romans, The Epiſtle to the Romans: but this of <hi>Iames</hi> is named to the Iewes ſcattered in all parts. And touching the two latter Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> although they are directed to particular perſons, yet the Argument of them is Catholike or Vniuerſall, alike concerning all Chriſtians; and not particular, as the Arguments of the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> for the moſt part of euery of them are. For although, euen in them generall duties concerning all are ſet forth, yet each of them is principally directed to particular points, to diſpute of which, particular occaſion was miniſtred by the Chriſtians of that place, to which the Epiſtle was ſent.</p>
            <p>This Epiſtle in order is the firſt, not becauſe <hi>Iames</hi> is to be preferred before <hi>Peter,</hi> who was the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d chiefe of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Gorran.</note> if there were any ſuch; but, as ſome haue well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe this Epiſtle is to all Iewes in all Countries, who were the firſt people of God, and had the Goſpell firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto them; whereas the other of the Catholike Epiſtles, are to the Gentiles that beleeued in all parts of the world. Wherefore <hi>Ierome</hi> ſetteth them in this order alſo,<note place="margin">Hieron. prolog.</note> though the Latines, reſpecting the dignity of <hi>Peter,</hi> placed his Epiſtles firſt.<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> 
               <hi>Pareus</hi> holdeth, that they ſhould rather bee put in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order, firſt, 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> and then <hi>Iames,</hi> becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> wrote that Epiſtle firſt, and then <hi>Iames</hi> following <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame, after both which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the Hebrewes. Howſoeuer, this matter needeth no great diſpute, ſeeing order in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Bookes of holy Scripture is not ſo preciſely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: yet in reaſon, ſeeing Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Epiſtle is <hi>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natim</hi> to the twelue Tribes, but Saint <hi>Peters</hi> is not ſo, and his ſecond Epiſtle is to all Chriſtians; if any preference be giuen
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12860:17"/>to an Epiſtle in the placing thereof in reſpect of them to whom it is written, this of <hi>Iames</hi> ſhould be firſt, and then thoſe of <hi>Peter</hi> together, it being neuer vſed to ſeparate the Epiſtles of one and the ſame Author, but to place them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This Epiſtle is ſaid to be of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> and ſo it is intituled by <hi>Beza</hi> both in Greek and Latine,<note place="margin">Euſeb.

If it be demanded, which <hi>Iames</hi> wrote it, for there were two of that name, <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> a Kinſman of our Lord, and therefore called his Brother alſo, as <hi>Iames Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> before ſpoken of was? I anſwer with <hi>Pareus</hi> and others, that the conſideration of the time when it was written argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the firſt of theſe, <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of <hi>Iohn</hi> cannot be the Author of it, but <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Iames</hi> the leſſer:<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> for the elder <hi>Iames</hi> was ſlaine by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> before the diſperſion of the Iewes the ſecond yeere of <hi>Claudius,</hi>

               </note> who did afterwards caſt the Iewes and Chriſtians out of the City, and then in the time of their diſperſion was this Epiſtle written vnto them, as appeareth by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12860:18"/>thereof.<note place="margin">Enſeb. lib. <hi>2</hi> c. <hi>22.</hi> Hieron. in Catal.</note> If it be obiected, that <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> both doe report, that it was anciently doubted of, whether it be Canonicall or no: I anſwer, that they did onely mention ſuch a thing, but they did not doubt hereof themſelues. If it be further obiected, that he doth not call himſelfe an Apoſtle, but the ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, I anſwer, that <hi>Paul</hi> in ſome of his Epiſtles in ituleth himſelfe likewiſe, the name of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle being omitted; and neither <hi>Iohn</hi> nor <hi>Iude</hi> write them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Apoſtles, but only <hi>Peter.</hi> Laſtly, if it bee obiected, that here is ſomething deliuered contrary to that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> touching iuſtification not by ſaith onely but by workes, and anointing with Oile is mentioned, which none of the other Apoſtles ſpeaketh of: I anſwer, that I haue already ſhewed vpon <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. that the ſeeming contrariety betwixt Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> is nothing, they being rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and touching the anointing with Oile, it ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the proper place. As for any thing elſe obiected, it is not worth the naming, and therefore I come directly to the Epiſtle it ſelfe, wherein after a ſalutation, he comforteth them, as the preſent occaſion of their diſtreſſed eſtate did require; and hauing called their troubles herein temptations, he taketh occaſion to ſpeake alſo of inward temptations tending vnto euill, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. prouing that they come not from God, one ſpeciall reaſon of which is, that euery good and perfect gift is from him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. and to proue this, hee doth inſtance in the great gift and grace of our regeneration, which is of God by his Word, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. and therefore inferreth a readineſſe to heare this Word, remouing the ill effects that through mens owne corruption follow of hearing, wrath and ſpeaking in wrath, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſetting downe the right vſe and end of hearing, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, to driue all men from ſpeaking in wrath, he ſheweth the vanity of his religion that doth ſo, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. and to perſwade to loue and pure affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in hearing, the contrary to which he had commanded to lay apart, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. he commendeth charity, whereby our loue is moſt declared, and of which it is ſaid, <hi>Giue almes of that yee haue,</hi>

A great rich man is in the office of a great Steward, wherein he may doe good to many, and therefore in ciuility may be reuerenced by the poore, and by all men may ſo bee preferred as his place is. But if out of an interiour eſtimation of ſuch a man in the heart, thinking him to be better, becauſe he is richer, and the poore more vile and worſe, becauſe they are outwardly more baſe; if in this minde, he with the gold Ring and the gay clothes be honoured, and he that goeth in poore clothing be debaſed, this is a ſinfull accepting of perſons, and ſuch as ought not to be amongſt Chriſtians. Muckiſh earth-wormes indeed, that know not wherein true worth ſtandeth, are wont to meaſure their eſteeme of men by theſe things, thinking him a moſt excellent and happy man that hath the wealth and dignities

Againe, to reuerence the rich that are vicious for their riches, and to ſhew all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt toward the vertuous poore, is a great ſinne, becauſe by thoſe that doe ſo, riches are preferred before vertue, which is plaine iniuſtice,<note place="margin">Hieron.

Of all theſe, I preferre that as moſt genuine, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it of making more account of ſome than of others in outward reſpects, as if not Faith, but worldly things did moſt dignifie a man; for it is not ſaid, with reſpect of perſons; but, in reſpect of perſons: place not the dignity of thoſe that come into your aſſemblies in outward pompe and brauery, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming one the more becauſe he hath this, and another the leſſe when he wanteth it; for this were to hold, that the worth and dignity of Faith ſtandeth in theſe baſe and outward things, and ſo to vilifie and diſgrace it, which indeed alone is moſt excellent, and maketh the true beleeuer to excell all others, though outwardly he be moſt poore and meane.</p>

                  <p>From hence to the end of the Chapter,<note place="margin">Mayer.</note> there is onely one point handled againſt thoſe, that bearing themſelues vpon their faith, neglected the workes of mercy; to perſwade vnto which, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> hath here vndertaken. The maine queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, is what he meaneth, when he denyeth that a man is iuſtified by faith only, and affirmeth iuſtification by workes. Becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of iuſtification ſaith, That it is <hi>by faith without the works of the Law.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Oecumenius</hi> conſidering theſe propoſitions of theſe two Apoſtles, ſeeming to bee ſo contrary,<note place="margin">Oecumen. in Iac. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> and yet that <hi>Abraham</hi> is brought for example by them both, ſaith, the word Faith is taken two wayes: firſt, for a ſimple conſent vnto the thing preached that it is true. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for a conſent ioyned with the aſſecution thereof out of an affection, and with obedience: of the firſt of theſe <hi>Iames</hi> affirmeth, that a man is not iuſtified hereby. But <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the other, aſcribeth iuſtification vnto it. The word Workes is alſo to be vnderſtood two waies, for there are works before Baptiſme, and workes after: he that dieth immediatly after Baptiſme, dieth iuſtified by his Faith without workes, becauſe he had no time to doe any; but he that liueth and hath time to doe, is not iuſtified without good workes: which is to be vnderſtood, not as though good workes had a part in the act of our iuſtification, but becauſe they cannot but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow as fruits and effects in whomſoeuer there is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and iuſtifying Faith. Touching <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, was iuſtified by Faith, but <hi>Iames</hi> by workes; both are truly ſaid of him, and doe indeed agree in one. He beleeued that he ſhould be the Father of many Nations, hee beleeued Gods promiſe touching his ſeed, and this was counted vnto him for righteouſneſſe: and when he came to the worke here ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> the offering of his ſonne, hee did not fall from this Faith, for he beleeued that God was able to raiſe him from the dead againe. All the Ancients generally, as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> intimateth, ſpeake to the ſame effect about iuſtification by Faith without workes, <hi>viz.</hi> when there is no time after a mans
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12860:30"/>conuerſion to the Faith to doe workes, he being preuented by death, as I haue alſo partly ſhewed in ſpeaking vpon <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. How Popiſh Writers vnderſtand it, I haue alſo there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. In ſhort therefore, to reſolue this place, <hi>Oecumenius</hi> hath rightly ſhewed, that one Faith is ſpoken of here, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there; and that indeed the worke of <hi>Abraham</hi> in offering his ſonne, wherein it is inſtanced here, is the ſame with his Faith ſpoken of there; his worke is his working Faith, or Faith made euident by his worke, by a Synecdoche, or a Metonymy of the effect, as <hi>Pareus</hi> reſolueth it.<note place="margin">Pareus in Iac.</note> That by worke a working Faith is vnderſtood, is plaine from the words following. Verſ. 21. <hi>Thou ſeeſt that faith wrought together, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 22. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>That Abraham beleeued God,</hi> this beleeuing being attributed to his worke of offering vp his ſonne, <hi>v.</hi> 24. after <hi>Abrahams</hi> beleeuing mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he concludeth, <hi>ye ſee then that a man is iuſtified by Workes,</hi> making Faith and Worke all one. And this is in a manner all one with the common ſolution; Faith without Workes truly iuſtifieth before God, that is, maketh a ſinner iuſt by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus: but Workes make a mans Faith euident and conſpicuous to the world; it being hereby proued, that a man is a true beleeuer, and ſo accepted for iuſt and righteous before God.</p>

This, I confeſſe, is true, if we ſpeake of that Faith which is growne to more perfection,<note place="margin">Iob 19.25.</note> ſuch as was in <hi>Iob,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liueth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I liue by the Faith of the Son of God who hath died for me.</hi> But the Faith neceſſary to ſaluation commended vnto vs in the holy Scriptures, is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing with loue and affection ioyned hereunto. Such was the Faith of the Samaritans ſaid to be, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.42. Such a Faith <hi>Philip</hi> told the Eunuch if he had, he might be baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. and ſuch was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. And this is ſuch a Faith as none but the Elect can haue, the Deuill cannot haue it, for he beleeueth with an auerſation; the wicked can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue it, for there is the like auerſeneſſe in them alſo, or at the leaſt a deadneſſe of affection, for their Faith worketh not by loue, of which they are void. Here is alſo a certainty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12860:31"/>wandring or doubring, which is ſet forth as a property of true Faith: for it is without all doubting aſſented to,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.5.</note> that Ieſus is the Sauiour of the world, and that whoſoeuer rightly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth on him ſhall haue euerlaſting life. But as for certainty of a mans owne particular eſtate in grace, I ſuppoſe that is not ſo of the Eſſe of Faith, as the hee ſhould bee ſaid to haue no Faith who is not able for the preſent to apply Gods promiſes without doubting vnto himſelfe: for then wofull were the caſe of many true Chriſtians, who in time of temptation finde many feares and perplexities in themſelues: in ſo much that they are ready to ſay with <hi>Dauid, they are caſt out of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> though afterward they ſee their weakneſſe, and recouer their hold againe. Beſides this, particular aſſurance is a thing that is to increaſe daily as men grow vp in Chriſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no maruell if in thoſe that are yet children in the Faith it be not ſo ſtrong as it ſhould be. Certainly, true loue is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companion and fruit of a true Faith: and then who can deny it to be a liuely Faith, wherwith true loue concurreth, though ſuch aſſurance touching a mans owne particular eſtate be not yet atrained vnto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſeeſt, that Faith wrought together with his workes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, for ſo much as I haue ſpoken of his iuſtification by his worke, I would not haue it vnderſtood but with reference to his Faith, whereby he brought forth this worke; ſo that Faith as the cauſe, and worke as the effect, did perfectly iuſtifie him, ſo that his worke was in no part cauſe of his iuſtification, as though his iuſtice ſtood herein, but hereby his Faith was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, becauſe without it his Faith could not haue beene a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and liuing Faith, as it is not in any other man. Euen as he that from his heart, without any diſſimulation, aſſenteth to any thing that is iuſt and equall, is in that inſtant honeſt and iuſt; but this aſſent of his is perfected by his act, when he doth accordingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Scripture was fulfilled ſaying,</hi>

                     <hi>that Abraham belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſſe;</hi> that is, by this fact he ſhewed that he beleeued, and in his beleeuing, whereby he did it, ſtood his iuſtice, and not in the doing of this thing: nothing can be plainer for iuſtification by Faith;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12860:32"/>and to declare, that what is attributed to worke in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is meant of a working Faith, as hath beene touched already.</p>
                  <p>Touching the concluſion,<note place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>v.</hi> 24. it muſt not be vnderſtood, but according to the Premiſes, that when a man bringeth forth the fruit of Faith, he is iuſtified, and not when he doth barely beleeue, not being able to ſhew his Faith by any ſuch fruits.<note place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> And to this alſo do the laſt words, <hi>v.</hi> 26. agree, <hi>as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without a ſpirit is dead, ſo is Faith without workes.</hi> Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſtifieth not; becauſe being alone without Workes it is dead and vnprofitable, as a Carkaſſe without a ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Note,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that to beleeue only in Chriſt doth not auaile vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but when with the apprehenſion of the loue of God toward a man in Chriſt, which is the greateſt loue that euer was, doth concurre the loue of our Neighbour for his ſake; for this is a liuely and working Faith, the other Faith onely. And therefore this hearty loue, vttering it ſelfe in the acts of mercy, is moſt neceſſary vnto ſaluation; not becauſe ſaluation is hereby merited, but becauſe the life and ſoule of a true Faith lieth herein. So that they are wonderfully deceiued, that thinke to be ſaued by beleeuing onely, hauing their hearts har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in ſinne in the meane ſeaſon, and hauing no regard to doe good workes: and we are vniuſtly taxed by the Papiſts, as crying downe good workes, when we teach iuſtification by a true and liuely Faith, and deny it to bee in part by Workes. For we preſſe vnto good workes as much as they, but that we doe it vpon a true ground, holding, that it is no liuely Faith that wanteth Workes; they vpon a falſe, holding, that Workes, together with Faith, doe iuſtifie; or, that Faith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man iuſt, but Workes more iuſt; that of iuſtification by Workes in part, being a preſumptuous inlargement of that which of old was taught touching <hi>Abraham, who beleeued God, and this was counted to him for righteouſneſſe:</hi> this being made more iuſt, a wicked inuention of their owne braines, without all ground in the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Note againe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that a man may beleeue the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and hold much truth in fundamamentall points, and yet be in no better eſtate than the Deuill; ſo that it maketh
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12860:32"/>nothing for the credit of the Ieſuites, that in many points they hold the truth, for ſo much as their practiſes are deuilliſh and damnable, and it may be ſaid likewiſe of the whole rabble of Papals ſeduced by them.</p>

To which purpoſe one ſpeaketh nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; The Spirit of Faith is a good Oratour before God, but the ſenſe of the fleſh an ill one. He that hath this Spirit, is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12860:40"/>mortified together with Chriſt, and ſo doth not fight, ſtriue, &amp; enuy, but what he needeth he asketh in the Spirit of Faith, and receiueth as much as is ſufficient for his ſpirituall life. Now the minde that is ſpirituall, doth not aske worldly things for the loue which it hath to abound herein to liue the more deliciouſly to the pampering of the body, but for neceſſary vſes, that a man may liue to glorifie God, and to doe good herewith. They which doe otherwiſe, ſhall not ſpeed, though they aske and beg moſt importunately. <hi>To ſpend vpon their pleaſures,</hi> then is, not onely for neceſſity, or that they may haue wherewithall to doe deeds of charity, but that they may haue ſuperfluity and ſo maintaine themſelues, according to the pompous manner of this world, which who ſo hath, being a worldling and without grace, ruſheth into fleſhly pleaſures properly ſo called, as the Sodomites, whoſe ſtate is deſcribed to be ſuch,<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.49.</note> as that they had <hi>fulneſſe of bread.</hi> And thus I aſſent vnto <hi>Piſcator,</hi> that theſe kinde of pleaſures are principally meant here, though I ſee all others goe another way, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the words following of adulterers and adultereſſes by the ſpirituall adultery.</p>

And for the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, their anointing is farre differing from that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12860:45"/>in the Apoſtles daies.

Then anointing was vſed to cure the bodily diſeaſe, of which they that were ſicke, were preſently healed: but now it is vſed, when men are ready to depart out of this life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch effect. 4. If anointing were anciently applied for a ſpirituall good, it was but for a ſigne onely, it being held, that all the good came by prayer vnto the ſick, as <hi>Victor</hi>

                  <p>But now anointing is vſed for the remiſſion of ſinnes, and to procure happineſſe to him that is ready to depart out of this life; yet there is ſome difference amongſt them that hold this. <hi>Lombard</hi> ſaith, that onely veniall ſinnes are done away by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Vnction. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

Now, although the forgiuing of ſinnes is here mentioned, yet it is not attributed to the anointing, but becauſe ſinne is the cauſe of all ſufferings, &amp; ſin remaining, there is no hope of being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, therefore as our Sauiour Chriſt, when he would comfort the palſie man, in reſpect of the healing of his diſeaſe, hee bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him, <hi>Be of good comfort, thy ſins are forgiuen thee;</hi> ſo here to ſhew that they ſhould be healed, he ſaith, <hi>If he hath committed ſin, it ſhall be forgiuen him.</hi> And this is obtained by hearty and penitent prayer, which now wee ought to make our refuge, without this vaine Ceremony ſo long agoe iuſtly left, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed againe, as ſuperſtition began to inuade the Chriſtian world.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12860:45"/>in <hi>S. Iames</hi> his time, whilſt a miraculous ſanation did follow anointing in the name of the Lord, it was well appointed to be vſed.

It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be vnderſtood, that God by his prouidence diſpoſed it ſo, as that all did not fly to theſe meanes, but ſuch onely as hee had appointed to be healed; or ſuch Elders as had the gift of healing went not but onely to them, and at ſuch times as by his ſpirit they were directed to goe.</p>

If any man erred in the matter of circumciſion, vſing it now vnder the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Gal 5.1. 2 Theſ. 2.11.</note> he is pronounced to be ſuch as that <hi>Chriſt ſhall not profit him.</hi> And to beleeue lyes is ſet forth as the way of deſtruction, to which diſobedient perſons are in iudgement giuen ouer.<note place="margin">Iohn 17.17.</note> It is the truth that ſanctifieth and ſaueth, and therefore errout muſt needs corrupt and deſtroy.

                  <p>But that the wearing of coſtly apparell, and conſequently of broided haire and gold, is not ſimply vnlawfull for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an women, appeareth by <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Iudith</hi> before named; and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent ſuch ornaments to be put vpon <hi>Rebecca;</hi> and the vertuous woman is deſcribed to be cloathed with ſilke and purple.

Neither is <hi>Cyprian</hi> or <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſo ſharpe againſt theſe things, but onely in the caſe of pride and vanity, and when they decke themſelues to pleaſe adulterers,<note place="margin">Tho.

And this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12860:61"/>to be the moſt genuine expoſition, becauſe hee addeth ſomething of a parity betwixt a married couple in reſpect of the beſt things, as <hi>heires together of the grace of life,</hi> ſo that, as wiues ought, according to that which was taught before, to obey and reuerence their husbands; ſo husbands ought to giue reſpect to their wiues, they being in ſome reſpect equall one vnto another. This honouring of the wife is by forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to deale with her by checkes and ſtripes as with a ſeruant; and likewiſe by putting her to any baſe office, which doth not ſure with the condition of ſuch an husband, and by louing and reſpectiue termes to ſpeake vnto her, and in place preferring her, and for food and apparell maintaining her according to his degree and quality: and for his vnderſtanding, the vſe of that is in wiſely admoniſhing her of ſuch things as be amiſſe, that by the force of reaſon being conuinced ſhe may reforme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That there ſhould be ſuch a mutuall ſtriuing betwixt man and wife, in reuerencing and reſpecting each other, the word <hi>likewiſe</hi> doth imply, <hi>Likewiſe ye husbands dwell, &amp;c.</hi> that is, as I haue hitherto exhorted women to imitate <hi>Sarah</hi> in reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their husbands; ſo doe yee giue honour to them alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe howſoeuer they are ſubiect vnto you, yet there is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reſpect from you againe due vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Note,<note place="margin">Note,</note> that a woman is not ſo much ſet forth by apparell as by vertue, and euery wiſe man will eſteeme better of her that is modeſt, and doth her duty well towards her husband, than of her that is outwardly moſt gorgeous and beautifull.

When they expected Gods pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that is, thinking that God would ſtill with patience beare with them. They were ſaued by the water, becauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lifted vp the Arke; and eight perſons are mentioned as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to him that ſhould riſe againe the eighth day, and to the time of the generall reſurrection, which ſome thinke ſhall be vpon the ſame day. Baptiſme is like vnto the Arke, and ſo is tribulation, through which a Chriſtian muſt goe in diuers things. Firſt, The Arke was made of boords hallowed, ſo the Church conſiſteth of perſons afflicted. Secondly, The Arke was of incorruptible wood, ſo are Chriſtians ſuch as will not be corrupted. Thirdly, They that were ſaued in the Arke, were ſaued by <hi>Noah,</hi> ſignifying reſt, ſo the Church is ſaued by Chriſt. Fourthly, Out of the Arke none were ſaued, ſo neither out of the Church. Fiftly, The waters being increaſed, the Arke was borne vp higher, ſo the Church grew greater by tribulations. But the Baptiſme that ſaueth is not any Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, for there is no ſuch thing in the Iewes baptizings, or in <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, or in that of heretikes, in which there is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water, but not the ſpirit: but the baptiſme vſed in the true Church, wherein the Miniſter demandeth, whether he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and renounceth the deuill, &amp;c. exacting a pure conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in him that commeth to be baptized, which good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tendeth to God, and he that comming with ſuch a conſcience is baptized,<note place="margin">Iuther in <hi>1</hi> Peter <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> is ſaued <hi>by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>exemplariter,</hi> riſing from ſinne to vertue, as he roſe againe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Chriſt is ſaid to be put to death in the fleſh, when the man Chriſt died vpon the Croſſe, his naturall faculties ceaſing, he not liuing by meat, and drinke, and reſt any more, as is vſuall amongſt men that are liuing here. And
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12860:65"/>he <hi>was quickned in the ſpirit,</hi> that is, was raiſed vp againe to a ſpirituall life, wherein he liueth for euer both in ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And liuing this life now he preacheth not vocally, as hee did, but ſpiritually, when his Apoſtles and other Miniſters preach, being ſpiritually preſent with them vnto the end of the world. The ſpirits, vnto which he is ſaid to preach, are they that were ſometime diſobedient in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> not that they preciſely are meant, but ſuch as they were: for when hee preacheth in wardly to mens hearts and ſpirits now, hee may well be ſaid to preach to the ſpirits in priſon, becauſe ſome are ſuch as they, that now are in priſon, were, ſo that they are in the number of rebellious ſpirits, to whom it is daily preached. Here is therefore a Synecdoche, whereby the part is put for the whole. The eight perſons preſerued, are ſaid to be ſaued by the water, becauſe when all others periſhed in the water, they were borne in the Arke vpon the waters, and eſcaped drowning. So likewiſe by Baptiſme, whatſoeuer is carnall &amp; naturall is deſtroyed, and we are made ſpirituall, when we are hereby receiued into the Church, as into the Arke, depending vpon Chriſt by faith. But it is nothing outward in baptiſme that ſaueth vs, but the couenant whereupon a good conſcience doth comfortably reſt, being able to ſay, This thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Lord vnto me, and therefore wilt performe it. <hi>By the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> that is, it being by faith apprehended not onely that Chriſt died for vs, but that he roſe againe to make his death effectuall vnto vs.</p>

                  <p>For my owne part I ſubſcribe to thoſe, that hold this to be the moſt obſcure place in all the Epiſtles; for no Expoſition that hath hitherto beene giuen doth ſo fully ſatisfie, but that ſome exceptions will lie there againſt. That of <hi>Arias Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> falleth of it ſelfe, becauſe they in the Arke were obedient, whereas this preaching was to the diſobedient. 2. That of Purgatory is a meere fiction, there being no ſuch place <hi>in rerum natura.</hi> 3. That of <hi>Caluin,</hi> applying it in part to the ſoules of the faithfull ſeemeth to be improbable, becauſe theſe were the diſobedient, and it is not onely ſaid, that hee preached, but <hi>went and preached,</hi> intimating a locall motion, and not onely a vertuall penetration. 4. To expound it of his preaching by <hi>Noah,</hi> is to peruert the order of the Text, according to which this his going muſt be after his inclining againe, and why ſhould he call the men liuing at that time ſpirits, which is a word no where vſed to ſet forth liuing men by, but either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels good or bad, or ſoules departed. 5. Much leſſe can the Gentiles bee vnderſtood by the ſpirits in priſon, amongſt whom the Apoſtles came, becauſe they were ſuch as liued in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> not men of like quality, but thoſe very men. 6. The Popiſh <hi>Limbus</hi> is but an imaginary place, and to hold
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12860:68"/>that any being in hell were deliuered againe, ſeemeth to be contrary to the holy Scriptures, as hath beene already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There remaineth then onely that of his deſcending to triumph ouer the Deuils, and to vpbraid the damned ſpirits with their infidelity and impenitency, ſhewing how iuſtly they were for euer therefore ſhut vp in that place of torment; and becauſe they of the old world were the moſt noted for their great multitude that went downe thither together; hee mentioneth them, but in them vnderſtandeth all other then damned ſpirits alſo. And this is the moſt probable of all other expoſitions, and moſt conſonant with the reſt of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. For this is one part of Chriſts preaching to conuince the impenitent, as iuſtly and certainly reprobate and damned, as appeareth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Here growth a great queſtion whether Baptiſme, which is outward, hath any effect to the ſauing of the ſoule, or whether all the vertue lieth not in Faith, and internall grace ſanctifying the ſoule and conſcience.

                  <p>Some of the ancient Fathers haue expounded this of the Goſpell preached to the dead, of the dead vnto ſinne,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> holding that men are ſaid to bee dead two waies: firſt, in ſinne; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, vnto ſinne and to the world, by being made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Chriſt in his death; and theſe laſt, by receiuing the Goſpell are ſtirred vp to condemne themſelues for their former carnall liuing, which they doe when they leade a new life.</p>
                  <p>To ſuffer for Chriſt here,<note place="margin">Tho. Aquin. Gorran. Iſidor.</note> is either to ſubdue carnall concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence by taming the fleſh, or elſe by expoſing the body to martyrdome for righteouſneſſe. It is, according to <hi>Iſidor,</hi> to ſuffer in the whole man, as Chriſt ſuffered in the whole man, both exteriour and interiour; the inner is the ſoule, wherein
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12860:70"/>we ſuffer by contrition; the outward is the body, wherein we ſuffer by macerating it, and by ſuffering both theſe waies, wee ceaſe from all ſinnes both carnall and ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For this cauſe it was preached to the dead;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> that is, either yee ought not for this cauſe to regard the blaſphemies of the wicked, or elſe for the auoiding of the danger of the Day of Iudgement, it was preached to ſuch as are ſpiritually dead, that iudging themſelues for ſuch things as they haue carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, they might eſcape Gods iudgement and liue, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31.</p>
                  <p>To take the ſix former verſes of this Chapter together,<note place="margin">Mayer.</note> wherein an exhortation is ſet forth from Chriſts death conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as I haue ſhewed in the Analyſis; Here are three doubts, 1. What is meant by our ſuffering in the fleſh,<note place="margin">Verſe 1.</note> whereupon followeth a ceſſation from ſinne. I anſwer with <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> that the ſuffering of death in the body cannot bee meant, though he who is ſet for example ſuffered death when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the fleſh: for <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. hee ſpeaketh of <hi>the reſidue of his time in the fleſh</hi> being ſpent, <hi>according to the will of God.</hi> Wherefore to ſuffer in the fleſh here is to be mortified to ſinne,<note place="margin">Luther. in <hi>1</hi> Pet. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> which to follow, it is a life vnto vs naturally. For as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, there were two ends of CHRIST his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as he was man, which is meant by his ſuffering in the fleſh; firſt, to ſatisfie for our ſinnes; ſecondly, to giue vs example, both of ſuffering perſecution, and of ſuffering by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortified vnto ſinne, as vnto luſt, or hatred and enuy: for if theſe inordinacies be ſubdued in vs, then we ceaſe from ſeeking how to ſatisfie our carnall luſts, and from attempting reuenge in word or deed. It is true, we are iuſtified by Faith when we firſt beleeue, and then the Spirit of Sanctification en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into vs, but we muſt be more holy and righteous daily, as he that had his wounds bound vp by the Samaritan was ſtaied from bleeding and being indangered any further there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but yet they were not altogether healed till after ſome time.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6, 7.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath a place to the ſame effect with this; <hi>Our old man is crucified together with him, that the body of ſinne may be deſtroyed, that we may not ſerue ſinne any longer.</hi> To medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon Chriſts Paſſion is a moſt effectuall meanes to make

But becauſe it hath beene the common recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued opinion of the Church thorow ſo many ages, I ſubſcribe rather to the allegoricall expoſition, that Rome is meant here. For <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to preach vnto the Gentiles alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. and ſo might well be at Rome, though there bee no certaine proofe hereof in ſacred Story, but rather a probability that hee
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:12860:75"/>was not there.

The Roman Catholikes contend the rather for this expoſition of the name, that it may appeare that <hi>Peter</hi> was at Rome: But be it ſo, yet by their owne choice Rome is called <hi>Babylon</hi> in the phraſe of Gods Spirit, and then <hi>Babylon</hi> is Rome, which is ſo infamous in the Reuelation, and that not heathen Rome, as they pretend, thinking thus to ſalue all againe; but popiſh Rome, as I haue ſhewed more at large there. His ſonne <hi>Marcus,</hi> who is ſaid to haue ſaluted them, was <hi>Marke</hi> the Euangeliſt, called his ſonne, becauſe he begat him by the Goſpell, as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Timotheus</hi> his ſonne. <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> ſpeaketh of him as his naturall ſonne; but <hi>Oecumenius</hi> confuteth that opinion, as hauing too weake a ground, <hi>viz.

It was written according to <hi>Baronius,</hi> as I haue ſhewed before vpon the firſt Epiſtle, three and twenty yeeres
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12860:76"/>after the firſt &amp; the ſame yeere that <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffered martyrdom. The Argument is a commendation of a godly &amp; vertuous life vnto them, leſt by his former Epiſtle they ſhould gather that it ſufficeth onely to beleeue, and an admonition to take heed of falſe Teachers, eſpecially, as ſome thinke, being occaſioned by the followers of <hi>Simon,</hi> and ſome by the Gnoſtickes, though that be more improbable, ſeeing <hi>Carpocrates</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that hereſie, or <hi>Baſilides</hi> were not in the Apoſtles daies. It ſeemeth that hee had ſome reuelation touching his martyrdome ſhortly to come, whereupon he toucheth, and therefore he was the more carefull to leaue this Epiſtle as a further <hi>Memento</hi> to all the faithfull. In his firſt Epiſtle hee ſought to arme the faithfull with comfort and patience againſt ſuch as troubled them; here he terrifieth the troublers of the Church, with threatnings of ſuch iudgements as God of old hath executed againſt the wicked. He beginneth in the firſt Chapter with ſalutations, commemorating the great grace of God in Ieſus Chriſt towards the faithfull, vnto <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. to the faith in whom he exhorteth to ioyne all Chriſtian vertues, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6. yeelding ſome reaſon, how that thus their faith ſhall appeare to be a true faith indeed, and their knowledge of Chriſt ſhall not be without benefit in the end, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will proue but vaine and fruitleſſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11. And then making ſome Apology for his remembring them of theſe things who knew them ſo well already, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth both by teſtimony from Heauen, of which he was an eare-witneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. that ſaluation is to be lookt for in Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17, 18. and by the teſtimony of the Prophets, exhorting them to be conuerſant in their writings for their further illumination and confirmation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.

We are made partakers of the diuine nature by the comming of our Lord and God, Ieſus Chriſt in the fleſh, for hereby the firſt-fruits of our nature are ſanctified, and if the firſt fruits be holy, the whole lumpe is alſo holy, ſuch as all they are, from amongſt whom the firſt-fruits are taken. And he calleth it the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, from which we are hereby eſcaped, becauſe the luſt whereby wee are tempted conſiſteth of corruptible things, and is conuerſant about worldly things, which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to corruption. Then follow the degrees of perfection; Firſt, faith. Secondly, vertue, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſtandeth in good workes. Thirdly, knowledge of the myſteries of God, which is not but to thoſe, that by being exerciſed in good workes get ready and quicke ſenſes. Fourthly, temperance, which is neceſſary for him that hath knowledge, leſt he be puffed vp hereby. Fiftly, patience, becauſe a man cannot be temperate without it. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, brotherly loue after godlineſſe, which maketh way vnto it. Laſtly, charity, which is the perfection of all.</p>

And thus we come to be partakers of the diuine nature, that is, of truth, righteouſneſſe, wiſdome, euerlaſting life, peace, ioy, and whatſoeuer deſirable thing can be named, for this is the diuine nature, and of all theſe the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doe partake: yet ſo onely, that they fly the luſts of the world. Wherefore in the next place he exhorteth to adde to faith vertue, &amp;c. that is, a vertuous and holy life in good works. 3. Knowledge, how to vſe the body by neither too much coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering it, nor wronging and hurting of it, as ſome in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of ſanctity haue done: for though God hateth ſinne which is in the fleſh, yet he would not haue the body deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore, but only, that the luſt ſhould be reſiſted. Againe, knowledge is when a man hath regard to honeſty, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in all his conuerſation outwardly. 4. Temperance is not only about meats and drinkes, but in all things both of ſpeech and deed a moderating of a mans ſelfe according to reaſon. 5. Patience, becauſe though a Chriſtian be neuer ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and moffenſiue in his life, yet the world will hate and perſecute him. 6. Godlineſſe, that is, whatſoeuer we doe or ſuffer, not to reſpect our owne glory herein, but the glory of God, doing &amp; ſuffering all for Gods ſake. 7.

Onely in ſpeaking of wiſdome, hee ſaith, it is about the carrying of our ſelues towards others, ſo that we may winne them; and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he ſaith, is about meats and drinks, by the intemperate vſe whereof offence is giuen; by godlineſſe, he vnderſtandeth the worſhipping of God by prayer,<note place="margin">Beza annot.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Beza</hi> alſo ſaith the ſame, that to be partakers of the diuine nature, is to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of thoſe qualities which Gods ſpirit worketh in vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

It may rather be gathered from hence, that our iuſtification is a permanent gift as nature is, as <hi>Lorinus</hi> alſo granteth, according to which the regenerate is called a new

                  <p>Touching the exhortation inferred hereupon,<note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. it tendeth to ſhew, that the faithfull now that they are in the ſtate of grace ought not to be ſecure, as if nothing more were required at their hands, but to beleeue: but they muſt vſe all diligence, and haue a care to ſhine in all Chriſtian comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of practice, for the order of which, that of <hi>Tho.

Onely with <hi>Piſcator</hi> I thinke that godlineſſe is to be vnderſtood of the exerciſe of godly duties, und withall of a godly minde, referring all our grace to Gods glory, and brotherly loue of the loue of the faithfull, and charity of the loue of all, euen enemies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors. For whatſoeuer good we doe, and whatſoeuer euill we auoid, if godlineſſe and loue be not adioyned, it is nothing worth.

                  </p>
                  <p>Note,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that the condition of the faithfull is moſt high and honourable, euen a partaking of the diuine nature, as <hi>Mordecay</hi> was made partaker of royall dignity, which is, when our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is changed, and of corrupt and impure, we become holy and righteous, for this is Gods nature. So that there is nothing in the world ſo much to be ioyed in, or to be aſpired ſo much after, as to be holy; and nothing ſo much to be ſhunned, as corruption: for if we be of the ſame nature with God, we ſhall alſo with him liue, and be bleſſed, and happy for euer.</p>

And therefore they are deceiued, that ſay, ſo they haue true faith they care not in what a ſmall meaſure they haue it, and how little it be: for to get as ſtrong a faith as may be will be little enough, ſeeing (as hath beene ſhewed in the former Epiſtle) euen the faithfull ſhall ſcarcely be ſaued.</p>

But this is a meere cauill of a man wilfully blindfolding his eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light. It is true indeed, that a man is not ſure ſo ſoone as he is effectually called to beleeue: for there is a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker faith, and a ſtronger faith: faith in the very firſt beginning giueth ſome aſſurance, but this aſſurance is confirmed more in time by goods workes. Though he which is conuerted at the firſt doth beleeue, yet being ſo newly come out of a ſinfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he cannot but be full of doubtings and feares, through which his beleefe may yet be called vnbeleefe, as he that came to Chriſt for his childe ſpake of himſelfe, <hi>Lord I beleeue, helpe mine vnbeleefe.</hi> And in this caſe it is that <hi>Peter</hi> biddeth to vſe all diligence to make our calling and election ſure. Or rather, becauſe he that ſeemeth to be called and elected, may haply be outwardly called only: he willeth vs to approue our calling by a vertuous and holy life, that ſo we may be ſure, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould be deceiued. The true collection to be made from hence is, that a man may be ſure and certaine of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and that he ought not to reſt till he hath attained vnto it, by applying himſelfe with all his power to liue ſo as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his Chriſtian and holy calling. For otherwiſe it were a vaine precept to endeuour to become ſure, if this were not to be attained vnto. I grant, that the law indeed requireth that which man cannot attaine to, touching doing, and yet not in vaine, becauſe hereby wee are continually remembred what man was by creation, and now finding it to be otherwiſe with him, hereby occaſion is giuen, the ſame charge ſtill lying vpon him, to ſeeke out to another, that is, Chriſt, in and through whom hee may attaine to the perfect fulfilling of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12860:80"/>Law. But the precept of the Goſpell which is to beleeue, and to be ſtrengthened in the faith through godly liuing, ſo that we may become ſure of our ſaluation, is not ſuch a thing, but that it may be fulfilled, being the laſt refuge left for man fallen now to recouer life againe, or elſe it were a vaine charge; euen as a man that is no way able to pay his debts, if hee be bidden to build a Church, or to deliuer vp ſuch an houſe and ground to his Creditor, which he hath not, and ſo he ſhal be exempt from going to priſon, ſhould be but vainly conditioned withall: but being bidden to goe of his errand an hundred miles, he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his charges by the way alſo, and ſo all ſhall be forgiuen him (as there is no reaſonable man, that hath a minde to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue his debtor vpon ſome condition, but will ſet ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as he can performe) he can performe what is inioyned him. But of this point of a certaine aſſurance of ſaluation to be attained by faith, I haue written already at large vpon <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 8.38.</p>
                  <p>Note,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that a wicked man loſeth all the benefit of his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and Chriſtian profeſſion: he hath indeed beene once wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from his ſinnes by baptiſme, but all that benefit is now as a thing quite gone and forgotten, and he hath loſt his way to heauen.</p>
                  <p>Note againe, that faith whereby we are iuſtified and ſaued,<note place="margin">Note.</note> is more certaine or vncertaine, as our care to leade a godly life is more or leſſe. Only the godly Chriſtian that from his heart-root deſireth and laboureth to liue in the feare of God, and to be alwaies doing of good, can be ſure that he is elected. All others may iuſtly feare a reprobation. The conſideration of this election breedeth much anxiety in many, who are much troubled about it, in ſearching whether they be elected or no. But they begin at the wrong end: if any man would be ſure in this regard, let him goe to worke as <hi>S.

This, howſoeuer it hath great and learned Authors, yet ſeeing this ſpeech is directed to them that did not yet ſo eſteeme of the Apoſtles, and reſt in their teſtimony touching Chriſt, doth not agree ſo well, becauſe they ſhould grow to be more fully informed by the light of the Goſpell in time, and therefore I preferre rather the former expoſition. For ſo much as they did not yet giue ſuch certaine credit to the Apoſtles, the Goſpell hauing not yet ſo fully inlightened them, he ſaith, that they did well to attend to the Prophets, till the day of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall knowledge ſhould come, and the day-ſtarre Chriſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12860:82"/>ſhould ariſe in their hearts by his holy ſpirit inlightning them ſo, as that they ſhould perfectly know theſe things.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>that no prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Scripture is of any priuate interpretation, &amp;c.</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, now that ye haue the Prophets and attend vnto them, before yee receiue any interpretation that ſhall by falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets be offered vnto you, as their priuate phantaſies leade them, ye muſt know, that no ſuch propheſie is to be receiued with ſuch interpretation, but as it hath pleaſed Gods ſpirit, from whom propheſies come, to explaine and make manifeſt the obſcurities thereof, becauſe as the propheſie is not of man, but of the ſpirit of God; ſo that is not to be receiued as the meaning thereof, which man deuiſeth, but which the ſame ſpirit mouing the Apoſtles and apoſtolicall men to expound it, declareth to be the meaning. The true interpretation,<note place="margin">Luther.</note> as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> hath it, is that which is approued by other places of holy Scripture, and that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> cannot hence be proued is a priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, how ancient &amp; how great a name ſoeuer he hath that is the author of it. The Papiſts oppoſe a priuate interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the common expoſition giuen by the Church, wherein the Pope is the chiefe, and ſo would haue none expoſition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſwayed by the Pope) is pleaſed to giue. But in contending thus for a publike expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, they make way for the priuate phantaſies of ignorant and ſenſuall beaſts, ſuch as many Popes haue beene. A priuate expoſition is oppoſed to that of men holy and learned in the Scriptures, and ſo able to make good thereby the expoſition: brought by them. If any wicked or prophane man ſhall bring an interpretation, or though he be well affected, if he be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and wanteth iudgement, it is to be reiected as a priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: that which is brought by the godly and learned, who are called to the expounding of the Scriptures, being made euident by other places of Scripture, is to be receiued. If it be obiected thus, there can be no certainty, ſeeing one bringeth one expoſition, and another another. I anſwer, that in fundamentall points the godly and learned that proue their expoſitions by the Scriptures, cannot differ; and if they ſhould, a Councell met together to reconcile the difference,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12860:83"/>chuſing one for preſident by a ioynt conſent, the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit being firſt craued, could not differ; and in the meane ſeaſon what expoſition we are by the ſpirit directed vnto, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by prayer recommended our ſelues vnto God, is to be embraced, ſo that we haue euidence of Scripture therefore. In points of leſſe moment the differences ſhall not need to trouble vs, wee may follow that which is moſt probable to vs, ſeeing as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh herein, <hi>Quiſque ſuo ſenſu abundat.</hi>

                  <p>Note,<note place="margin">Note.</note> what a time of light we liue in now vnder the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſo many as haue heartily embraced it. Before there was no more but (as it were) the light of a Candle in a darke place, a ſmall light was giuen in the myſteries of ſaluation by the Law and the Prophets, able to inlighten but one Nation, as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> ſpeaketh. But now it is the cleare day-light extending into all parts. And therefore it behoueth vs to walke in the light, leſt it turne to our greater condemnation, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19.</p>
                  <p>Note againe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that whatſoeuer any man bringeth out of the Scriptures, is not truth and to be embraced, but what is to be approued by the Scriptures; and therefore the new Creed, and all the ſuperſtitious and idolatrous worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is vtterly to be reiected, as comming from falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and not from any moued by the ſpirit of God, ſeeing it is altogether without ground in the holy Scriptures, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the chiefe point of the Popes head-ſhip and infallibility, whereupon all the reſt hangeth.</p>

                  <p>But the Ieſuice doth greatly wrong both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> herein, for they haue no ſuch doctrines, but they are his owne imaginations.

Whereas indeed, their doctrine is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12860:84"/>a denying of ſuch a Chriſt as is ſet forth in the holy Scriptures. For he is our onely Mediator and Aduocate, and by the merit of his death alone we are ſaued, and that which he hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red doth fully ſatisfie for all our ſinnes: but they teach more Mediators, the merit of our owne workes, and that by our owne ſufferings here and in Purgatory, we muſt ſatisfie in part for our ſinnes. The Scriptures ſet forth ſuch a Chriſt as is Lord ouer all; but they doe in effect ſubiect him to the Pope, aſcribing to him power to make more Lawes than Chriſt hath made, and to diſpenſe with his ordinances as in the Lords Supper, when Chriſt hath appointed to take the cup as well as the Bread, the Cup ſhall be permitted only to ſuch as the Pope thinketh fit.

So that when he ſaith <hi>againſt them,</hi> he meaneth not the Glories before ſpoken, but others that had beene Glories in heauenly places, and ſtill retaine the title of Principalities, &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. If it be expounded of the euill Angels, there is not the like againe to be found, where An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſet forth by a kinde of excellency are euill Angels, for when ſuch are ſpoken of, there is alwaies annexed ſomewhat, whereby it may be gathered that they are ſuch. Againe, being thus vnderſtood, the words would neither carry any good ſenſe in themſelues, nor agree to that which went before. <hi>They beare not blaſphemous iudgement againſt them:</hi> if hee had meant their owne iudgement and condemnation, he would haue added againſt themſelues, and not againſt them, and he would not haue called this iudgement blaſphemous, ſeeing it is the iudgement wherewith the Lord iudgeth them. And touching the words before going, being againſt falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for their railing vpon perſons of eminency, to aggrauate which ſinne, an argument is here taken from the Angels, there will be no correſpondency herein vnto them, if by the Angels are to be vnderſtood euill Angels, and by the blaſphemous iudgement their condemnation. For if it had beene thus
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12860:87"/>meant, he would haue ſaid before, but theſe contemners of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhall neuer be able to beare the iudgement due vnto them therefore, for the very Angels, who are of more power, beare not, &amp;c. whereas no compariſon is made betwixt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of puniſhments, but betwixt the impudency of the one in railing, and the modeſty of the other in forbearing.</p>

                     </note> how the Heauens and the Earth were ſet out of the waters: for God commanded that a Firmament ſhould be in the midſt of the waters, that is, a more firme exiſtence of waters, and this he called Heauen: and when as the earth was ouerwhelmed with waters, he likewiſe commanded the waters to gather together that it might appeare, and thus the earth was ſet out of the waters, the materiall cauſe being hereby deſigned, and <hi>by the waters</hi> noting out the finall; and as the earth came out of the waters at Gods command, ſo likewiſe the Heauens. For both are made out of the waters, the aire called Heauen out of their exhalation, and the earth out of their concretion. The earth therefore is out of the water, becauſe made out of it, and by the water, becauſe hereby, as by a kinde of glue is as it were cemented and made to hang together, which otherwiſe would diſſolue and vaniſh into duſt and aire. And as the Heauens and Earth had their beginning at the firſt from waters, ſo the force whereby vnder God commanding, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the concretion of the one, and the exhalation of the other is fire. Wherefore, as from theſe two all things had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſo for ſinne they haue beene deſtroyed by water, and ſhall againe be deſtroyed by fire, as not only Chriſtians teach,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12860:89"/>but alſo <hi>Hyraclitus Epheſius,</hi> and <hi>Empedocles Etneus.</hi> The Heauens and the Earth, &amp;c. that is, ſuch things as are vſefull for the ſuſtentation of mans life, as Corne, Graſſe, Trees and Beaſts, &amp;c. and not the ſubſtance of the Heauens and Earth. For man hauing grieuouſly ſinned, the world is ſaid to haue beene deſtroyed therefore by water, yet it was not conſumed: ſo hauing beene repleniſhed againe, and both by Law and Goſpell men being dealt withall to walke in obedience to God, but yet few profiting hereby, it is kept to be deſtroyed by fire; yet that as when a man purgeth things in the fire to fine them, or buildeth his houſe anew by vſing ſtill the former materials, ſo when the Lord ſaith, that he will make a new Heauen and a new Earth, and that this world ſhall be burnt vp with fire, it is meant only that the vtenſils hereof, which ſerue for a corporall life, ſhall be conſumed by fire, of which there ſhall be no further vſe: ſeeing we ſhall all then be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and thus a new face of all things ſhall appeare, in which regard it is called a new Heauen and a new Earth, becauſe thoſe growing things which would then be ſuperfluous being taken away, whatſoeuer auaileth to the adorning and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of this world, and is needfull to the incorruptible life to come ſhall be added. That theſe outward things are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and ſubiect to deſtruction, appeareth by their daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and dying againe.

I ſubſcribe to <hi>Beza</hi> for the reading, as indeed none can deny it; but with <hi>Gagneus</hi> and the Greeks I hold, that as the earth was ſet out of the waters, and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the waters, becauſe at the firſt no earth appeared, but all was couered with water; but the waters being commanded to gather together, the earth appeared, and it is by the waters as it were cemented and conglutinated, as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which is in ſhort here expreſſed; ſo becauſe in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to which this place hath reference, the making of the Heauens is ſo ſet forth as that we may eaſily gather how they are out of the water and by the water, I cannot hold this to be alſo intimated here. For the Firmament betweene the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12860:90"/>waters and the waters is called Heauen; this was out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe before the diuiſion betwixt the waters aboue and the waters beneath it appeared not; but after it came out betwixt them both, &amp; it is by the waters, becauſe in the midſt of them, <hi>by</hi> being as much as <hi>in.</hi> So that when he ſaith, <hi>The heauens were of old,</hi> it is to be vnderſtood, conſtituted out of the teaters &amp; by or in the waters; <hi>quod enim ſubint elligitur non deeſt.</hi> Whereas it is obiected by ſome, that though by the Heauen the Aire bee vnderſtood, yet by Heauens in the plurall number it is neuer ſo taken. I anſwer, that it may well be ſet forth in the plurall number in reſpect of the diuers Regions, neither is there any word in the Hebrew ſignifying Heauen, but in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number.</p>
                  <p>Touching the drift of the Apoſtle here thus mentioning the firſt originall of the Heauens and the Earth, it is very aptly and pertinently done; for as by the power of God, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Word, the Heauens and the Earth were made at the firſt, and wonderfully ſeparated from the waters, being no leſſe miraculouſly preſerued in that eſtate, ſo by waters all things were drowned againe, and once more by the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine appointment ſhall all things be deſtroyed by fire: for he that by his Word hath done theſe things already, how ſhall it be doubted, but hauing ſaid it, he will burne vp the world with fire alſo?</p>

Then there being in all likelihood ſome ceſſation of this burning, the iudgement ſhall ſucceed, after which the wicked ſhall goe into euerlaſting flames, and therefore, though they be ſaid to be deſtroyed, yet they are not ſo deſtroyed, but they remaine ſtill to endure fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther torment.<note place="margin">Martin.

                  <p>What others hold wee may ſee in the Text before going; for <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> holdeth, that by the Heauens and Earth are meant onely this inferiour world, conſiſting of the Earth and the Aire, which were once before deſtroyed by the Floud: and what others follow, either opinion I haue declared at large vpon <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. where I haue ſhewed, If the Heauens and the Earth ſhall be deſtroyed, yet it ſhall not be to their abolition, but that they may be reſtored to more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and glory, according to that paſſage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19 and ſeeing it is hereabout agreed amongſt thoſe that follow this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there needeth to be no great difference about the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that ſhall be deſtroyed, whether the ſtarry or the aerean

According to all theſe acceptions I thinke is the right vnderſtanding of the place.</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>The long ſuffering of the Lord,</hi> is called <hi>ſaluation,</hi> becauſe it is a meanes of ſaluation, when by being yet ſpared from iudgement the ſinnes is moued in this time to repentance, and ſo the more are ſaued; who otherwiſe, if the world had beene ſooner deſtroyed, muſt needs haue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. <hi>As our deare brother Paul hath written to you.</hi> Here are three queſtions moued: Firſt, whether <hi>Peter</hi> doth alleage <hi>Paul</hi> to confirme his doctrine, or wherefore? Secondly, what Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> is meant? Thirdly, in what part of his Epiſtle to them, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to the ſame effect with <hi>Peter</hi> here? To the firſt <hi>Occumenius</hi> anſwereth,<note place="margin">Oecumen.</note> that <hi>Peter</hi> being the chiefe of the Apoſtles, doth alleage <hi>Paul</hi> here in humility, not that he needed the approbation of his conſent. And indeed, both great humility and loue appeareth in this one paſſage, <hi>Paul</hi> hauing charged <hi>Peter</hi> ſo much in ſome part of his writing with doing amiſſe, and being worthy to be blamed,<note place="margin">Gal. 2 11.</note> yet <hi>Peter</hi> not ſtomaking this giueth him his due, that hee was a man of great wiſdome. And indeed, as ſome rightly note,<note place="margin">Tho. Aquin.</note> that <hi>Peter</hi> alleageth <hi>Paul</hi> to confirme that which he had written, becauſe being called extraordinarily, there might be ſome queſtion of his Apoſtleſhip; and againe, the truth being confirmed by more witneſſes, hath the more force in the hearers.<note place="margin">Luther.</note> Some doubt hath beene made, as <hi>Luther</hi> noteth, in regard of this citing of <hi>Paul,</hi> whether this Epiſtle be <hi>Peters</hi> or no, but as hee well concludeth, there is no reaſon to doubt of it, being ſo long agoe without contradiction receiued into the Canon, there being alſo ſo good reaſon of alleaging <hi>Paul.</hi> To the ſecond, ſome hold that no particular Epiſtle is meant vnto the Iewes,<note place="margin">Occumen. Beda. Th. Gloſ. Ordin.</note> but his Epiſtles in generall, in any of which, what is written of the laſt Iudgement and the ſtate to come, is written to all Chriſtian people. But becauſe his other Epiſtles are ſpoken of in the next verſe, it ſeemeth plaine to me that the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes in particular is meant, for <hi>Peter</hi> in writing here
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12860:96"/>to all the faithfull includeth alſo the Hebrewes that beleeued, intending their conſolation and inſtruction, as being chiefly of his cure; for the miniſtry of the Circumciſion was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and therefore he ſpeaketh here vnto them as the chiefe,<note place="margin">Beza.</note> pointing at the Epiſtle by <hi>Paul</hi> written to them, as <hi>Beza</hi> hath alſo noted. And ſo to the third, whereas <hi>Oecumenius</hi> and ſome others will haue that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. meant here. I thinke rather with <hi>Beza,</hi> that <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. &amp;c. is the place here intended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As alſo in all his Epiſtles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>ſpeaking of theſe things, in which things ſome are hard to be vnderſtood, &amp;c.</hi> Here alſo are diuers queſtions:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, of what things <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in all his Epiſtles. To this it is eaſily anſwered, that hee ſpeaketh of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, and of Gods long ſuffering and the vſe to be made hereof to be wonne to repentance, and a ſtudy of holineſſe: for the places are eaſie to bee found, wherein hee ſpeaketh of all theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to what <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>wherein,</hi> hath reference whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Epiſtles, or to theſe things. <hi>Robertus Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaith, that there are three copies, wherein it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which if it be ſo, the Epiſtles are plainly meant, &amp; <hi>Beza</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of this, becauſe if the argument in hand be meant, <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſpoken more myſtically hereof then <hi>Paul</hi> euer did. But the copies generally receiued, haue <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering the word, I thinke that both Epiſtles and the contents of them are meant, as alſo <hi>Beza</hi> firſt expoundeth it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, wherefore did <hi>Paul</hi> write in ſuch manner that he is hard to be vnderſtood,<note place="margin">Th. Anglic.</note> and not rather plainly? Some thinke, that this was done becauſe he would not haue the Heretikes to vnderſtand his writings, but for ſuch as were rightly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, he ſent ſome Diſciple or other to expound all things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as appeareth in ſome of his Epiſtles, where mention is made of them by whom they were ſent.<note place="margin">Irenaeus li. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> Hieron. Epiſt. <hi>50.</hi> Niſſen. Tractat. in <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>15.</hi> Chryſoſt. Hom. <hi>9.</hi> in <hi>1</hi> Cor.</note> Some ſay, that the profundity of the matters by him handled, is the cauſe why they are ſo hard to be vnderſtood, and becauſe through celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech he vſeth many Hyperbatons. Some, becauſe hee could not expound in the Greeke tongue, which hee did not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12860:96"/>ſo well vnderſtand, ſuch profound matters, and therefore he vſeth certaine peculiar idotiſmes and phraſes of ſpeech. But that one reaſon yeelded by our Sauiour Chriſt of his ſpeaking darkly and by Parables, ſeemeth to me to be a reaſon ſufficient of all the obſcure paſſages both in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> writings,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.12.</note> and in the reſt of the holy Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> that the wicked in hearing might not vnderſtand this obſcurity, being as a ſpirituall iudgement againſt them to their damnation, as is alſo intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this place, and that euen hereby we might be moued to craue the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit, and the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſigne our ſelues to be guided thereby in a ſpirituall and holy life, which is the way to vnderſtand theſe myſteries. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons may be yeelded, but this is the principall, and therefore I reſt herein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, ſeeing the Scriptures are hard to be vnderſtood, is it damnation to miſ-vnderſtand ſome hard paſſages of them? I anſwer, to miſ-interpret any hard paſſage ſo as to make it a ground of ſuch errors as ouerthrow the Chriſtian Faith in any part, is damnable, but not ſimply to miſ-vnderſtand any hard place whatſoeuer. As for example, when Saint <hi>Paeul</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth iuſtification by Faith without the workes of the Law, to vnderſtand this, as if no regard were to bee had vnto good workes, when he teacheth election to be of Gods meere grace and mercy, to vnderſtand it ſo as to caſt away all care of being ſuch as may haue the comfort of election, and when Chriſt affirmeth vnto <hi>Peter, Vpon this rocke will I build my Church, &amp;c.</hi> to vnderſtand it as a ground of the Popes infallibity of iudgements, ſo as that whether he be good or bad, learned or vnlearned, his dictates ſhall be accounted as God Oracles; theſe, I ſay, and the like miſ-vnderſtandings for their dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequences are wreſtings of the Scriptures vnto dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in ſtead of milke ſucked bloud being thus preſſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, which nouriſheth not, but deſtroyeth the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Whether were it not better to debarre the ignorant multitude from reading of the Scriptures, ſeeing there is ſuch danger in the miſ-vnderſtanding of many paſſages therein? So indeed hath the Church of Rome thought, but becauſe in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all are inuited to reade and to meditate, euen in the darkeſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12860:97"/>places of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Keuel. 1.3.</note> no ſuch infere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ought to be made, but rather the people are to be exhorted in reading not to follow their owne ſenſe, and not once to incline to any expoſition contrary to faith and good manners, and therefore to reade that whereby they may vnderſtand the true faith and morall Lawes, neuer grounding any Tenent vpon an obſcure place, vnleſſe it be alſo plainly taught in ſome other place of holy Scripture, which is the onely approued way of interpreting Scripture, as I haue ſhewed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. That anciently all were exhorted to reade the Scriptures, I haue ſhewed vpon <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.19.</p>
                  <p>Note hence,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that vnity of Doctrine was amongſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and it was the ioy of one to follow another in teaching the ſame things, holding, that by their vnanim conſent, the truth taught by them was the more confirmed, which maketh againſt thoſe that loue to be ſingular in their teaching, they take the very way to Schiſmes and diuiſions.</p>
                  <p>Note againe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that the Scriptures are not ſo eaſie, but that there is need of ſtudy and helpe of learning to vnderſtand them rightly, and yet ſuch as belong to God ſhall vnderſtand them, how hard ſoeuer they be: according to that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12.</p>
                  <p>Note laſtly,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that to be ignorant and vngrounded in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is the cauſe of wreſting the Word of God to a mans owne deſtruction, which was appointed for his ſaluation. So that it ſtandeth euery one in hand to get knowledge and to be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly reſolued, and to take great heed in what ſenſe hee taketh the Word of God in any part thereof, ſeeing that if this ſenſe proue a wreſting of it, it tendeth to damnation.</p>

Here is no weight of reaſon in any of theſe, but in this onely. The Greeke Interpreters generally hold,<note place="margin">Graesi interpres.</note> that the commandement of loue is ſaid to be new, becauſe of old we being commanded to loue our neighbours as our ſelues; by the new commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpell wee are commanded to loue them more than our ſelues, euen to dye for them, as Chriſt loued vs to dye for vs.<note place="margin">Rupertus.</note> And thus <hi>Rupertus</hi> expoundeth it alſo.

                  <p>Note, that when wee endeuour to leade an holy life,<note place="margin">Note.</note> if through humane frailty we ſinne, there is yet a meanes to be iuſtified and ſaued from our ſinnes if wee flie thereunto; that is, Chriſt Ieſus, by his mediation ſeeking reconciliation with God, but not by any other whatſoeuer; for he is our Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and the propitiation for our ſinnes, let the Papiſts ſhew if they can, that partly by any other a propitiation is made for vs, or that we haue any other Aduocate, and we will hearken vnto them. If they cannot, but onely argue from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, let vs ſtill be guided by Gods Word, and whilſt they without ground here doe that which their blinde reaſon perſwadeth them, let them take heed of a dangerous fall in the end.

                  <p>Note laſtly,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that to loue one another hath euer beene Gods command, but chiefly it is expected now vnder the Goſpell.

For although little children in yeeres are not in any danger by the loue of the world, yet little children in this ſenſe are in danger as well as fathers and young men, and therefore had need that the charge ſhould be repeated to them alſo.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12860:105"/>not to doe it, becauſe it becommeth children to obey their Parents; now our heauenly Father forbiddeth this, who hath forgiuen you your ſinnes, and therefore great reaſon is there that ye ſhould refraine from that which cannot ſtand with the loue of him who hath ſhewed ſo great loue vnto you. Again, ye fathers ought not to loue the world, becauſe ye haue knowne him that was from the beginning, whom the world hateth; ye know him by Faith being ioyned vnto him, ſo that ye cannot loue the world which is againſt him. Laſtly, <hi>yee young men</hi> ought not to loue the world, becauſe yee haue ouercome that euill one, that is, the Deuill, who is the God of this world; whereas it is the part of one vnder his dominion to loue the world, not of one that hath ouercome him, for ſo hee ſhould againe be ouercome by him.

                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it is hereſie contrary to Chriſt, making them Antichriſts that hold it; and hereby he ſheweth that it is the laſt houre, that is, the ſixt age, or a time like to that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt for the greatneſſe of the perſecution, or in reſpect of euery particular mans life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe Heretikes are ſeparate from the Church; <hi>They went out from vs</hi> to Iudaiſme or Paganiſme, <hi>becauſe they were not of vs</hi> by election or predeſtination: they were amongſt vs by the partaking of the ſame Sacraments, but not by the communion of loue. <hi>That they might be made manifeſt,</hi> that is, that by their going out they might be diſcouered to be falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and we might be no longer deceiued by them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe they had an anointing whereby they knew all things, that is, the holy Ghoſt, whereby they knew the malice and wickedneſſe of theſe Antichriſts, and ſo were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to withſtand them; and he calleth it an anointing <hi>from the holy one,</hi> that is, from Chriſt, from whom, as an head, all knowledge and grace is deriued to vs his members, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe the doctrine of Heretikes is a lying do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the moſt hainous lying of all, becauſe it is to the denying of Chriſt. Now the Iewes properly denied Ieſus to be the Chriſt, but all Chriſtians that obey not his precepts, doc indeed deny him, as <hi>Titus</hi> 1. <hi>They ſay, that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him.</hi> And ſuch an one is Antichriſt, that is, an enemy to Chriſt; and hath not the Father neither, that is, propitious to him, or knoweth not the Father, for <hi>if ye had knowne me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>yee had knowne my Father alſo.</hi>

                  <p>The doubts of this place are: firſt, how it is ſaid to bee the laſt houre. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> pitching firſt vpon that of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular man who hath but a ſhort time to liue here,<note place="margin">Chryſoſtome.</note> yeeldeth afterwards an other reaſon out of <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> becauſe any time diuided into three parts, when the two former are paſt, that which remaineth is called the laſt; and ſo two parts of the worlds age being paſt, which hee calleth houres, hee calleth the time vnder the Goſpell the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:12860:106"/>laſt houre. And yet he yeeldeth another reaſon why it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the laſt houre, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is the worſt, by reaſon of the Deuills being moſt buſie with his temptations, and ſtirring vp troubles and perſecutions againſt the Church more than in times paſt.

                     <hi>now is the laſt houre,</hi> that the laſt times are now at hand wherein Chriſt will come to iudgement, becauſe the Antichriſt is to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the world, and when his forerunners are come, it is euident that it will not be long before he commeth. I ſubſcribe to that of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> the time of the Goſpell is the laſt houre, becauſe the third and laſt part of the worlds age: 2000. yeeres were before the Law, 2000. vnder the Law, and ſo if a like proportion of time be to this laſt as was to the two former, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> might well ſay in his time it was the laſt houre, though the world be not yet ended. The words will not ſo well beare this interpretation, without wreſting, the laſt houre is at hand, or is like vnto the laſt: for he ſaith plainly, <hi>It is the laſt houre,</hi> and repeateth it againe, <hi>There are many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts, whereby we know that it is the laſt houre.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, The comming of Antichriſt argueth the laſt houre; now are many Antichriſts, that is, now he hath begunne to enter vpon the ſtage by his fore-runners and to act his part, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now is the laſt houre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond doubt here is, who is the Antichriſt, and by whom they heard of his comming? The Lord Ieſus ſpeaketh diuers times of one comming in his owne name, whom they would receiue, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.43. <hi>Ch.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.15. And <hi>Daniel</hi> long before, <hi>Ch.</hi> 7.11, 12. deſcribed this Antichriſt in his type; and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. after which this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was written. Now hee ſpeaketh of him in the preſent tenſe, <hi>he commeth,</hi> both for the certainty, and becauſe hee was come then in his forerunners, the many Antichriſts of whom he ſpeaketh, in regard of whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The myſtery of iniquity now worketh.</hi> For they and he are all vnited in the ſame wicked and lying ſpirit by which they are deceiued, and deceiue others to their deſtruction. The Papiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the Antichriſt is but one man yet to come, who ſhall reigne but three yeeres &amp; an halfe immediatly before the day
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12860:107"/>of iudgement. But ours teach him to be a ſucceſſion of men, who are all as one, continuing from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to doe the ſame Antichriſtian acts in the ſame place; euen as each beaſt of the foure ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> ſerued to ſet forth the ſucceſſion of Kings in each Monarchy of the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Medes, Perſians and Greekes.

What will not theſe men dare to ſay, that are of ſuch impudency to diſgrace and gaine-ſay what an Apoſtle of Chriſt hath written, if it maketh againſt their conceits.

                     <hi>Faber</hi> ſaith, that he tooke away ſinne by deſtroying the ſeed of the Deuill ſowne in <hi>Adam</hi> at the beginning, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp in his of-ſpring euen vntill Chriſt, who was without all ſinne, which if he had not done, none could haue remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in God. But he being a ſeed, contrary to the ſeed of the Deuill, deſtroied it, which is darkneſſe, and would haue made otherwiſe, that we could not haue beene in God, who is light. He alſo inferreth the ſanctity of the mother of Chriſt, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her to be without ſinne, or elſe ſhee could not haue brought forth ſuch ſeed contrary to the ſeed of the Deuill. But by the ſame reaſon her father and mother muſt haue beene without ſinne alſo, and conſequently, the Line of which ſhee was deſcended. I hold with <hi>Faber,</hi> that Chriſts taking away of our ſinnes here ſpoken of, is by the grace and vertue of his Spirit, ſanctifying vs to leade an holy life: for by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, the Spirit of grace is communicated more plentifully, the man Chriſt being as it were the head of the ſpring where the Spirit reſted, and we the chanels into which it floweth; whereas in times paſt, though the faithfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Iewes were not deſtitute of the Spirit, yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:12860:112"/>but a handfull in compariſon of the reſt of the world, the beſtowing hereof was not ſo notable, and few there were that were deliuered from their ſinnes. According to this ſenſe it agreeth beſt with the words following, therefore they which are in Chriſt ſinne not, ſeeing that in him there is no ſinne, yea he came into the world to take away our ſinnes. A like place vnto this is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. And ſo I come to the greater queſtion ariſing both from hence and from the next words, wherein the regenerate are ſaid not to ſinne, neither can they ſinne. In what ſenſe doth hee thus often, ſo much preſſing it alſo, ſpeake of our immunity from ſinne, ſeeing there is no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that ſinneth not? It is agreed by all, that the regenerate ſinneth not purpoſely, or by the ſinne of infidelity, or ſo farre forth as he is borne of God,<note place="margin">Tho. Aquinas.</note> or he ſinneth not vnto the end, for all theſe expoſitions are mentioned by <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> It ſeemeth to me to be moſt plaine, that trading in ſinne is only meant here. The true faithfull perſon liueth not as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man doth; though he cannot but through humane frailty ſinne, yet his heart is againſt all ſinne, and his life is ſuch a continuall practice of repentance, and the Spirit of Chriſt doth ſo ſway and carry him, as that he falleth not ſo often as the naturall man doth, and he doth daily waſh and cleanſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from ſinne by the teares of true repentance, and that when there is no worldly ſhame or loſſe to moue him hereunto, Neither can I ſee but that the regenerate muſt needs be of ſuch an holy life, as not at any time to fall into any great ſinne, as of adultery, murther, theft, drunkenneſſe, or the like, although vnder the Law moſt holy men haue fallen, for the Spirit is now giuen in a greater meaſure than it was in thoſe daies, and the force of corruption is more abated, as is cleare from ſundry paſſages of holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> that the <hi>Deuill ſinneth from the beginning,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne of God appeared that he might diſſolue the workes of the deuill,</hi> the meaning is, that he was euer the Author of ſinne, by his temptations ſo preuailing amongſt men, as that the world hath hitherto beene full of ſinne: but now the Sonne of God comming, hath giuen a contrary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the hearts of his people, whereby they are ſanctified to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12860:112"/>leade an holy and new life. The Deuill had them before, as it were in the chaines of ſinne, faſt bound for ſtirring to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe ſuperſtitious and riotous courſes, but now theſe bands are looſed, and they are ſet at liberty to walke in the waies of Gods Commandements, becauſe free will, which was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> is reſtored in the regenerate by Chriſt, that we may now ſtriue againſt and reſiſt euill temptations.</p>
                  <p>Note, that the moſt certaine marke of a childe of God,<note place="margin">Note.</note> is to leade an holy life, and truly to endeuour to refraine from all ſinne, out of an inward affectation of holineſſe, and the diſlike and hatred of euery ſinne, be it neuer ſo pleaſing or profitable to the outward man, and not in any by-reſpect; and being ouertaken with ſinne by infirmity, to be humbled therefore, and to beg for mercy and pardon, and that <hi>toties, quoties.</hi> The comfort of thoſe that doe thus is, that they are not now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſinners, but are iuſtified here-from,<note place="margin">Luke 13.</note> as it is ſaid of the poore Publican, that hauing knocked vpon his breaſt, and humbled himſelfe, he went away iuſtified.

This feare is the leſſe, the more grace a man hath attained vnto, but at the day of iudgement, when charity ſhall be perfected, there ſhall be no ſuch feare at all, but all confidence and boldneſſe, to which feare is here oppoſed. Feare of puniſhment is in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of grace, but after ſome proceedings made herein, this worketh no more but the feare of offending God, becauſe he is good and gracious, ſo that there is no painfulneſſe now any more in reſpect of the puniſhments to come, but the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the minde, that is, ariſeth out of a ſollicitude and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe about being in Gods fauour, and continuing therein, in reſpect of our owne infirmities.</p>

                  <p>Note,<note place="margin">Note.</note> how great the excellency of loue is, in that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is ſaid to be loue, it is thus ſpoken of him in reſpect of any other attribute of righteouſneſſe, or wiſedome, or power, but onely of loue that we might the more prize his endleſſe loue

               <p>IN this Chapter the Apoſtle treateth of faith, prouing that the faithfull loue the children of God, becauſe they loue God, and that they loue God becauſe they keepe his commandements, vrging to beleeue in Chriſt becauſe of the teſtimony which God the Father hath giuen vnto him. The coherence of it with the former is this. Hauing proued that he which loueth God muſt needs loue his brother, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to confirme it further from the conſideration of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith. Hereby we are begotten of God, and therefore we cannot but loue others, that are begotten of him alſo, and the ground of this is our louing of God the Father, both of vs and them; for he that loueth a man, loueth his children alſo for his ſake, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1, 2. So that this is indeed a new argument, we cannot loue God, but we muſt loue our brethren alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the begotten of God, this being the ſtate of euery faithfull perſon. And hauing reaſoned ſo much about the loue of God, he ſheweth in the next place what this loue is, <hi>viz.</hi> to keepe his commandements, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2, 3. and that it may not be thought hereupon, that no man then can loue God, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the faithfull haue the Spirit whereby they are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the loue of God, as that this is their continuall

Then becauſe the obiect of faith is Chriſt Ieſus, hee ſheweth by what certaine teſtimony he came, that wee might vndoubtedly beleeue, preſſing the ſame, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and then what benefit doth redound to the beleeuer, euen eternall life, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12. for which cauſe he ſaith, that he wrote vnto them, reſuming againe the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching boldneſſe before vſed, <hi>chap.</hi> 4 17.

            <head>THE CATHOLIKE EPISTLE OF THE Apoſtle IVDE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epiſtle is and hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for canonicall Scripture in all ages ſince the Apoſtles daies; no doubt being made, but that <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Author of it, was an Apoſtle.<note place="margin">Luther in Iude.</note> Onely <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> coniectureth, he was but a Diſciple of the Apoſtles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. hee exhorteth to remember the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.<note place="margin">Perkins in Iude.</note> But one anſwereth this well, that he liued after <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and writing this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle when they were dead and gone, hee might well put them in minde of their writings, being of ſo great note and name, that to alleage any thing formerly taught by them, was likely to moue the more. And in tracking <hi>Peter</hi> in his 2. Epiſtle, Chapter 2. which is another thing obiected, he doth no more than hath beene formerly done in the Bookes of Chronicles, ſetting forth many things had before in <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Kings;</hi> and by the <hi>Euangeliſts,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Marke,</hi> whoſe Goſpell
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12860:126"/>is almoſt nothing elſe but an abridgement of <hi>Matthew.</hi> This <hi>Iude</hi> is called alſo <hi>Thaddeus, Mark.</hi> 3.18. and <hi>Lebbeus, Mat.</hi> 10.3. which two words according to <hi>Rabanus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rabanus.</note> ſignifie one thing, <hi>viz. Cordis cultor,</hi> a purifier of his heart, or one that husbandeth the heart. It is generally thought that he had all theſe names, but in the Goſpells is called <hi>Lebbeus,</hi> or <hi>Thad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus,</hi> not <hi>Iudas,</hi> becauſe the Euangeliſts had a deſire to blot out the memory of <hi>Iudas</hi> his trechery, by leauing out the name from amongſt the reſt of the Apoſtles. But it ſeemeth to me, that hauing diuers names, they were promiſcuouſly vſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch reſpect: for if they had had a deſire that the name of <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould haue beene forgotten, they would not haue put <hi>Iudas Iſcariot</hi> into the number as they doe, and this Author would not haue written himſelfe <hi>Iudas,</hi> but <hi>Thaddeus</hi> or <hi>Lebbeus,</hi> in the ſuperſcription of this Epiſtle. But haply becauſe though others called him <hi>Lebbeus</hi> or <hi>Thaddeus,</hi> hee in modeſty would not affix this name, ſignifying a dreſſer of the heart, leſt he ſhould ſeeme to arrogate to himſelfe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to one.<note place="margin">Th. Aquinas.</note> But hee writeth himſelfe, <hi>Iude, the brother of Iames,</hi> that is, of <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> who is by many ancient Hiſtorians reported to haue beene the firſt Biſhop of Ieruſalem, and for his moſt holy life, of wonderfull reputation euen amongſt the Iewes themſelues. And therefore many Expoſitors thinke, that <hi>Iude</hi> here maketh mention of him as being his brother, to purchaſe the more credit to his Epiſtle. But if we obſerue the Lords ſending forth of his twelue Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by couples, we ſhall finde that <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> and <hi>Thaddeus</hi> are coupled together;<note place="margin">Mat. 10.3.</note> and with the other, <hi>Iudas</hi> the traitor, <hi>Simon</hi> was coupled. To the end therefore that he might diſtinguiſh himſelfe from that <hi>Judas</hi> ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, he beginneth, <hi>Iudas</hi> the brother of <hi>Iames,</hi> as by Chriſt they had beene formerly coupled.</p>
            <p>Touching the Argument, all agree that there were certaine filthy Heretikes ſprung vp in the Church, that vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Chriſtian liberty did liue in a moſt ſenſuall manner, and contemned the Magiſtrates authority,<note place="margin">Epiphan.

The booke of <hi>Nathan,</hi> of <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Semeias,</hi> of <hi>Iddo, Ahia,</hi> and <hi>Iehu,</hi> mentioned in the Chronicles, but yet ſo many haue beene preſerued, as that we neede no more vnto ſaluation.<note place="margin">Perkins in Iude.</note> Some againe will not yeeld by any meanes that there was euer any ſuch booke of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that was canonicall Scripture, neither that theſe bookes before mentioned were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, affirming that the booke of the warres was but a ciuill Chronicle, and whatſoeuer was ſet forth in the other bookes, is all contained in the bookes of Kings and Chronicles. For my owne part, I thinke that there was ſome ſuch booke of <hi>Enoch,</hi> to the certaine knowledge whereof, they that liued neare the Apoſtles times might come by their relation, and if of <hi>Enochs</hi> ſetting forth,<note place="margin">Faber Stap.</note> it muſt needs bee canonicall and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, but yet is now Apocryphall, as one ſpeaketh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hid and we know not where it is; and it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that this might befall ſuch a ſacred booke, there being yet nothing in it for ſubſtance, but what is in thoſe that we haue now. <hi>Enoch</hi> was a moſt holy man, and moſt ancient, and therefore what is produced of his muſt needs be of force. The number of canonicall bookes was not then made vp, and therefore there might be a miſ-carrying of ſome,<note place="margin">Gagneus.</note> as one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſpeaketh, but now they ſhall continue preſerued for the perfecting of the Man of God, without the loſſe or corrupting of any to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>Thouſands of his Saints are put for an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: the Lord commeth or hath come, as in the Greeke ſpeaking after the manner of Prophets for the certainty of the

               <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.15. (though the Rabins doe ſtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether it ought to be reckoned amongſt the immediate workes of the holy Ghoſt) ſo this reuelation was very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently receiued into the Canon, witneſſe the Councell of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra</hi> in the appendix, which was before the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the third <hi>Carthag.</hi> Councell, <hi>Can.</hi> 47. And good reaſon, ſeeing it was written by an inſpired Apoſtle, and is teſtified by the Author to be the Reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Touching the ſcope of this booke, the ancient Fathers haue giuen vs little or no light into it. For howſoeuer ſome of them haue written vpon it, as <hi>Iuſtin Martyr, Ireneus Lugdunenſis,</hi>

               <hi>and there are few things in it by the manifeſtation whereof other things may be found out with labour, chiefly becauſe he doth ſo repeat the ſame things many waies, ſo as that he may ſeeme to ſpeake diuers things, when as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is found out to ſpeake the ſame things diuers waies.</hi> And with him <hi>Ierome</hi> conſenteth, ſaying, <hi>The Reuelation of Iohn hath as many Sacraments as words, in euery word many vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings lie hid.</hi> For this cauſe euen they which haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vpon it, haue generally acknowledged that they were a long time afraid to aduenture vpon ſo difficult a worke: but ſith experience in theſe latter daies doth helpe much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten theſe darkneſſes they haue profeſſed, that they haue with great aſſurance ſet forth their expoſitions, reaping rather more comfort and ſupport from hence than from any booke of the holy Scriptures beſides. And for mine owne part, I muſt needs confeſſe, that almoſt twenty yeeres are now paſt ſince my entrance into the Miniſtery, before I durſt attempt any thing about ſo great a worke. Amongſt all the beſt Writers that I haue ſeene, it is generally agreed that the ſcope of this booke is to ſet forth both the eſtate of the Church of God then vnder the figure of thoſe Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and thenceforth to the end of the world. Onely ſome doe ſo vnderſtand all things after the fourth Chapter, to bee ſpoken of that which was to come, as that they admit of no mixture of things paſt, whereas others vnderſtand in ſome of the viſions, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of ſome things paſt alſo, for the more orderly proceeding to things to come. Againe, ſome expound the Epiſtles to the ſeuen Churches, as Propheticall; others only as Hiſtoricall, granting that in them all are indeed admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſhed whoſe caſe is alike. Laſtly, ſome hold that euery ſucceeding viſion almoſt ſetteth forth a new thing to come; but others, that the whole period of time to come, from the daies wherein this booke was written with the moſt notable euents, are comprehended in euery viſion, and ſo the ſame things are againe and againe iterated vnder diuers ſimilitudes,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:12860:135"/>the former ſetting them forth obſcurely, the latter more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But whether coniecture be moſt probable, we ſhall ſee in the proper places as we ſhall come to them in order.</p>
            <p>Concerning the title of this booke, with the ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation thereof in the three former verſes, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence amongſt Expoſitors. For all agree, that the Apocalyps in Greeke, or Reuelation in Engliſh is an opening of hidden things, ſuch as all things to come are, and therefore though they bee but darkly reuealed, yet not ſo darkly, but that wee may by diligent ſearch vnderſtand them, elſe how is it a Reuelation? Neither is it loſt labour to take great paines to vnderſtand what is here reuealed,<note place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> ſeeing they are pronounced bleſſed that reade and heare, and keepe that which is here written. And whereas it is intituled,<note place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The Reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt, which God gaue vnto him;</hi> it is by all agreed, that this title is put vpon it for the honour of the worke, and becauſe it was not <hi>Iohn,</hi> but <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> that reuealed theſe things by his Angel vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> and it is ſaid to bee giuen him of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his humanity.

Againe, touching the ſeuen ſpirits the ſame Author ſaith, that the holy Ghoſt is thus called, reſpect being rather had vnto the gifts of the ſpirit in the Saints, than vnto his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and thus he is ſaid to ſtand before the throne, not as infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, but for orders ſake here and elſewhere the Spirit and the Son are ſpoken of, as miniſtring to the Father, becauſe by them the things here ſet forth are immediatly executed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Sonne is put in the laſt place, in regard of the large deſcription of him intended, as by whom wee are made partakers of all benefits. <hi>Pareus</hi> reckoning vp diuers expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe words, <hi>which is, which was, and which is to come:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pareus.</note> (ſome vnderſtanding them of the Sonne, which is one God with the Father, which was in the beginning, and is come to iudge all men; and ſome of the Father, which is of himſelfe, hauing his beginning from none, which was before all time, &amp; which is to come to iudge the world: &amp; ſome of the eſſence of the Trinity, euery Perſon being by this periphraſis vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) expoundeth them of God the Father, though common to euery hypoſtaſis, as a periphraſis of his eternity; which is now, was before all worlds, and ſhall be for euer and euer: for ſo <hi>which is to come,</hi> is to be expounded, which ſhall be without any mutation or ſhadow of change, and hee obſerueth the ſame deſcription of the Sonne, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. Touching the ſeuen ſpirits, hee ſheweth, that ſome haue taken ſo great offence at this, that they haue reiected this booke for ſetting forth ſeuen ſpirits, when the Spirit of God is but one. Some againe by the ſeuen ſpirits vnderſtand the ſeuen Angels, that miniſter before the throne of God, as <hi>Lyra, Andreas, Ribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, &amp;c.</hi> for there are ſeuen principall Angels to whom the care of mankinde is committed, of whom it is ſpoken, <hi>Tob.</hi> 12.15. <hi>I am the Angel Raphael, one of the ſeuen which are before the Lord:</hi> and <hi>Clem.

               <hi>There are ſeuen Angels who haue the greateſt power, by whom God prouideth for all men.</hi> But this cannot ſtand, becauſe he prayeth for grace from the ſeuen ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to giue which, is a propriety of the godhead onely, and therfore the ſeuen ſpirits are ioyned vniuocally with God the Father and the Son, as being together with them the efficient cauſe of grace. By the ſeuen ſpirits therefore in this place, is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:12860:137"/>to be vnderſtood the holy Ghoſt, according to the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expoſition both of ancient and moderne Diuines: it is called ſeuen ſpirits, either for the multiplicity of graces, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference being had to the ſeuen Churches; for which it is as ſufficient as if there were ſeuen ſpirits. Touching Ieſus Chriſt put in the laſt place, it is to bee vnderſtood, that a preciſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is not obſerued in other places in ſpeaking of the Trinity: for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. Ieſus Chriſt is firſt named, and then God the Father. All other expoſitors ſpeak almoſt to the ſame effect, ſo that what hath already beene ſaid, may fully ſuffice for the reſoluing of all theſe doubts, without adding more. Whereas there is a little difference in expounding that periphraſis of God, <hi>which is, which was, and which is to come,</hi> vnderſtand both his eternity, and his immutable conſtancy, and it will eaſily be reconciled: and ſo it will be no ſmall comfort vnto vs to conſider, that God will be the ſame gracious God vnto his Church, that euer he hath beene, and is ſo farre from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, as that he is euen now vpon the point of comming to accompliſh what he hath promiſed.</p>

            <p>And hitherto of the proeme or entrance of this booke: now followeth the body of it, which <hi>Pareus</hi> diuideth into ſeuen
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:12860:138"/>viſions: the firſt whereof, is from <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. of this Chapter to the end of the third, containing nothing propheticall, but altogether doctrinall and hiſtoricall. The other ſix viſions are altogether propheticall of things to come, but onely in three places, where the argument of the viſion requireth a repetition of ſome things paſt, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. where is a repetition of the firſt beginning of the Goſpel, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. where mention is made of fiue kings which had beene before, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. the beginning of the binding vp of Satan for a thouſand yeeres, being begun fiue and twenty yeeres before at the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, when the Iewes had no further power to hinder the proceedings of the Goſpel. Theſe ſix viſions are not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued prophecie of things to come, which ſhall in ſuch order ſucceed one another, (for moſt of them doe extend to the end of the world) but like vnto a Tragedy, wherein the fame things are diuerſly acted. For ſo what is repreſented in the firſt viſion here by one appearance, is repreſented againe &amp; againe in others by other appearances: the firſt ſetting things forth more obſcurely, the other more plainly; and this iteration is made for more aſſurance, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw a ſheet let downe from heauen three times. And as in a Tragedie in euery ſcene there is muſicke to giue the more content, and to delight the mindes of the ſpectatours; ſo in theſe viſions there is ſinging and praiſing of God. Theſe viſions yet doe not all of them ſet forth the whole period of time to the end of the world, nor the ſame occurrences within the compaſſe of the ſame time, which one ſetteth forth with another, but one ſome moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable matters, and another others happening in that time. Foure of them are vniuerſall containing the whole time, the firſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. the ſecond, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8, 9, 10.11. the third, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12, 13, 14. and the ſixt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20, 21, 22. The other two are particular, becauſe they ſerue to ſet forth onely the two laſt parts of the whole time, which is diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſoure. Firſt containing the time of the Churches wreſtling, and flouriſhing vnder the perſecutions of heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, till <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great. The ſecond, the time of reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and growing corrupt, till the ariſing of Antichriſt. The third, the time of Antichriſts oppreſſion, till the two witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:12860:138"/>The fourth, the time of Antichriſts ruine and vtter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And theſe two laſt times only are handled in the fourth and fifth of theſe Propheticall viſions, the one ſetting forth the deſtruction of Antichriſt vnder ſeuen vials, <hi>chap.</hi> 15, 16. and the other by caſting him into the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, <hi>chap.</hi> 17, 18, 19. And thus he ſheweth, that <hi>Nicolaus Collado</hi> before him vnderſtood theſe viſions; and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> giueth an hint of it, when as he ſaith, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth repeat the ſame things many wayes,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>20.</hi> de ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is agreed by all, that hereby is meant, that he ſaw not the things following with his bodily eyes, but being in a tranſe, the Spirit reuealing them to him, his ſoule being for the time taken out of his bodie, and carried away with the Lord to behold them, as the old Prophets, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were.<note place="margin">The Lords day.</note> The Lords day was the time wherein Chriſt aroſe from death, and therefore obſerued amongſt Chriſtians for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſemblies, as the Sabbath was by the Iewes. And as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and appearings of Chriſt vpon this day, ſo this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation at the ſame time maketh not a little for the honouring of this day. Wherefore the Apoſtles appointed the aſſembling together vpon this day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. and it hath beene euer ſince obſerued accordingly.

Brightman.</note> Some vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe Churches as typicall, figuring out the ſeuerall conditions of the Church of God in diuers ages of the world. The Church of Epheſus figureth out the ſtate of the Church in the daies of the Apoſtles and Apoſtolike men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing next after them, at what time there remained ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, ſo painfull, powerfull, zealous, watchfull, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and conſtant a miniſtery, that albeit the myſtery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was then working, yet they were ſo watchfully marked and mightily reſiſted that ſought to bring in error, that it was borne downe and truth held the place: but yet ſo, as that by ſome declining, a ſtep was made to that next heauier degree in the Church of Smyrna. The Church of Smyrna figureth out the ſtate of the Church when heretikes got the vpper hand, as in the daies of the Arrians, and whereas hee comforteth them without any threaning, hee hath reſpect vnto his poore perſecuted people, whom only he taketh for his Church, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the reſt as deſperate: but he reproued the declining in the age before as curable and not ſo hainous, but that yet
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:12860:142"/>he made reckoning of them as of his Church. Pergamus ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth that time wherein error had ſo much preuailed, that Antichriſt was in his Throne, maintaining idolatry and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fornication: yet there was a Church then that kept it ſelfe pure, though for want of ſtrength and courage ſhee did not make ſuch reſiſtance here-againſt, being deceiued by the pretext of propheticall authority, as of <hi>Balaam.</hi> Thyatira ſetteth forth the time of the firſt diſcouering of Antichriſt, when ſome zeale and loue of the truth beganne to be kindled in mens hearts, but yet in ſuch a weake meaſure, as that though they kept themſelues from drinking of the cup of the Whore, yet they had not courage enough to challenge and to oppoſe Antichriſt. Sardis ſetteth forth the time of reformation, wherein neither <hi>Balaam</hi> nor <hi>Iezabel</hi> are ſuffered any longer; but becauſe it reſted in the outward hauing of the Word pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached without any power in the heart, this Church is ſaid to haue a name to be aliue but is dead. Philadelphia ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth thoſe Churches now, which though they are but of little ſtrength, yet haue quite put downe Satans throne, and re-erected Chriſts Throne; for which cauſe it is promiſed, that they ſhall be eſtabliſhed as a Pillar not to be remoued any more. Laodicea ſetteth forth the Churches, that thinking they haue ſufficiently come out of Babel, grow ſecure, being drawne after worldly riches and honours, and deſpiſe poore Philadelphia and the rule of <hi>Dauids</hi> Key.

                  <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> whoſe Doctrine tooke effect <hi>anno</hi> 1527. but is not ſo commended for that monſter of vbiquity, deuiſed for the maintenance of the reall preſence in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; the ſixt, in Philadelphia, beginning about the ſame time, but a little after by the meanes of <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> who taught rightly touching the holy Sacrament, and put all gain-ſayers to ſilence; and this Church is the Heluetian, Sueuian, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuan, Belgian, French and Scottiſh; the ſeuenth, typified in Laodicea, is the Church of England, beginning <hi>anno</hi> 1547. in the daies of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt: for though the Scottiſh Church were after, yet for ſo much as it is the ſame with the Heluetian and Geneuan in doctrine and manner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our Church of England doth plainly differ from theſe in the outward pompe and ſplendor of it, and both the German, Heluetian, and Engliſh, perſiſt in the forme firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in each place, they may well bee counted three diſtinct Churches, typified in Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. And to make this coniecture the more probable, he ſcanneth the ſignification of each name and the ſite thereof. Epheſus is ſaid as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, omiſſion: for it was noted to be the fartheſt gone in ſinne and idolatry of any other. The Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians were worſhippers of the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſo ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinning,<note place="margin">Tuſcul. quaeſt. l. <hi>5.</hi> Strabo.</note> that one <hi>Hermodorus</hi> was caſt out from thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a frugall man, wherefore one writeth of them for this, that they were worthy to die. So they of the Gentiles, which were firſt conuerted, were found altogether ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſinnes and idolatries. And as Epheſus was the chiefe of all theſe Cities, and ſtood neerer to the Sunne, for the reſt were more North-ward; ſo it fitly ſetteth forth the firſt Church, which was the chiefe vnder the Goſpell and fulleſt of light. Smyrna hath the name from ſweet ſmelling myrrh, and ſtandeth North-ward from Epheſus three hundred and twenty furlongs, fifty figuring out the next age wherein was leſſe light, but as great zeale in ſuffering for the truth, and more need to be comforted by being reputed as ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling without any taxation, becauſe they ſuffered at the hands of Chriſtians, which was moſt grieuous to bee borne. Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſtandeth further North-ward from Smyrna, than Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:12860:143"/>from Epheſus, <hi>viz.</hi> fiue hundred and forty furlongs, where the light is much more diminiſhed: it ſignifieth the Tower of Troy, according to <hi>Heſychius,</hi> a lofty and proud place. And ſuch was the Church in the third ſpace of time, Antichriſts throne being erected, and all things with darkneſſe ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Thyatira ſtandeth from Pergamus South-ward, but more to the Eaſt, about foureſcore Engliſh miles, according to <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and ſo is neerer to the Sunne. It is called Thyatira, as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Daughter: for ſo in the fourth ſpace light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to breake out againe, and piety as a Daughter new borne to grow. Sardis ſtandeth more Southward than Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, and ſignifieth hypocriticall, and ſo fitly reſembleth the time of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> wherein more light brake out, but not without the coniunction of ſome groſſe errors. Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia is ſeated in a dangerous place, and therefore is not ſo full of inhabitants, and ſignifieth brotherly loue: this therefore may fitly typifie thoſe Churches wherein loue and humility doth moſt abound, and leaſt humane ſtrength and ſecurity. Laodicea was a great and famous City builr by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and called by the name of <hi>Laodice</hi> his wife: it was rich and full of people, and had great dominion, and accordingly called the Prince of people, giuing them Lawes; and therefore may well typifie the Church of England. Hitherto <hi>Brightman.</hi> This coniecture, I confeſſe, ſauoreth of much induſtry in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into theſe holy myſteries, and hereof good vſe may bee made when any Church ſhall perceiue how like ſhe is in her condition to any of theſe. But I cannot thinke that the intent of the Lord was to propound theſe Churches as typicall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſucceeding ages. Firſt, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> is bidden to write the things that are in this place, and the things that ſhall bee hereafter being diſtinct from the preſent, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together, the one being plainly expreſſed, the other darkly ſhadowed out vnder it. Secondly, becauſe if the Church of Smyrna ſhall figure our the ſecond age, wherein Arianiſme raged ſo much, all taxations could not haue beene paſſed ouer in ſo much ſilence, but ſomething ſhould haue beene ſaid to intimate this monſtrous blemiſh of thoſe times, ſeeing the Arrians were Chriſtians, and ſo to be reckoned as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:12860:144"/>of the Church. Thirdly, becauſe the Lutheran Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Sardis, is bidden to remember what ſhe had receiued and heard, whereas they haue not gone from that which they were firſt taught: and it is ſaid that there were ſome there worthy, whereas if their errors be taxed, all holding the ſame, ſome could not haue beene preferred. Onely therefore thus farre I yeeld with moſt Expoſitors, that there is no condition of the Church at any time in any place, but the caſe hereof is ſet forth vnder ſome one of theſe, and theſe Epiſtles were therefore thus directed that wee might learne by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for which cauſe it is ſo oft repeated, <hi>Hee that hath an eare to heare let him heare what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi>

The firſt vice is gluttony and drunkeneſſe, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ouer which is firſt propunded, becauſe it is in vaine to ſtriue againſt any other ſinne, vnleſſe this be ſubdued, which was ſhewed in the combate of our Sauiour Chriſt, his firſt temptation was in this kinde. To the victory here to eat of the tree of life is promiſed, which <hi>Adam</hi> could not, becauſe he
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:12860:146"/>was this way vicious: this is to bee refreſhed ſpiritually here and hereafter. The ſecond vice is feare of worldly miſeries: to him that ouercommeth this, not being driuen from the faith hereby, it is promiſed, that he ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death. The third is the loue of pleaſure: to him that ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this, the hidden <hi>Manna</hi> is promiſed, diuine conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The fourth is enuy, againſt which is oppoſed the ruling ouer nations. The fift is lechery, againſt which white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are oppoſed.

But me thinkes, that the eternall reward of their conſtancy ſhould not be ſo variouſly propounded for nothing: and touching the Churches in ſeuerall ages, although there be ſome likelihood in the firſt being ſo applied, yet in the reſt it faileth. Wherefore I hold, that the obſeruation of the ſeuerall vices, againſt which we haue to fight, is not impertinent here, although haply in the number and particularizing of them there may bee ouermuch curioſity. But certainly eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe doth counteruaile all the pleaſure and profit of ſinne, and whatſoeuer detriment or danger may accrue through piety, ſhall fully be made amends for thereby: and it doth not a little helpe to vnderſtand this, to propound it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the diſtinct title of the reward here ſet forth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe to other Churches, I finde nothing amongſt Expoſitors: but it is plainly according to the argument of the Epiſtle wherein mention is made of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> who was ſometime a Queene and reigned ouer the people of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing much tyranny againſt them. Wherefore, as it was needfull, they are comforted with a promiſe of reigning and ſubduing all their enemies at the laſt when for a time they had held out in their encounters with them, without ſhrinking away from the truth for feare. Againe, for the morning ſtarre, it fitly anſwereth to their <hi>not knowing of the depth of Satan as they call it,</hi> for which it is likely they were counted ſhallow and weake of vnderſtanding, in that they could not ſee into ſuch a profound point of the liberty of Idolathites, &amp;c. For though they were in this regard for a time contemned, as void of that light which was in others of <hi>Iezabels</hi> Sect, yet they ſhould haue a farre brighter light beſtowed vpon them, namely the morning Starre, as a token of the true light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they then were, when as the other indeed had no more light than could come from Satans darke dungeon. So that if there be any thing to diſcourage thoſe that bee in the right, either of violence or deriſion, the comfort to come will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and encourage againſt them all, becauſe if they be reigned ouer now by perſecutors, they ſhall reigne then ouer them; if they be inſulted ouer and diſparaged, they ſhall be honoured by being declared of a farre more excellent condition than their aduerſaries. For the meaning of theſe things, it is not vnuſuall to ſet forth our reigning in Heauen, by ſaying, <hi>They ſhall ſit vpon twelue Thrones and iudge the twelue Tribes of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:</hi> and <hi>the Saints ſhall iudge the world,</hi> from which here is no great variation, <hi>ſhall haue power ouer nations,</hi> which is further amplified by ſaying, <hi>and ſhall rule them with a rod of iron, and breake them in peeces like a Potters veſſell;</hi> a ſpeech taken out of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:12860:151"/>the ſecond Pſalme, to ſhew that they ſhall partake of the ſame honour of reigning with Chriſt, whoſe reigne is there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, according to <hi>Bullenger,</hi> and <hi>Pareus, &amp;c.</hi> So that the word nations ſetteth forth wicked enemies of the truth, as of old the Gentiles or Nations alwaies were. But euen as Chriſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came &amp; ruleth ouer all, ſo ſhall the faithfull reigne with Chriſt, and as a Potters veſſell is not able to ſtand againſt a bar of iron, no more ſhall they be able euer againe to ſtand againſt Gods people, but ſhall irreparably be cruſht in pieces through the weight of Chriſts anger, as an earthen veſſell being broken can neuer be made whole againe, all which is a great glory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and becauſe the godly ſhall coumunicate with him in all his glory, all this is aſcribed vnto them alſo. Thus <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> vnderſtand this paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. But others of the conuerſion of the Gentiles, as <hi>Chryſoſtome, Auguſtine, Theodoretus, Beda, Euthym.</hi> and ſo they expound the rod of iron to be a Scepter of equity, but this can by no meanes ſtand. Some alſo vnderſtand this place of rule and dominion here ouer enemies of the truth, as <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Primaſius,</hi> but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the victory is not till the end, and this reward is not giuen till the victory bee obtained, it is plaine that the reward to come in Heauen muſt needs be meant.</p>

The word

                     <hi>Philadelphia</hi> ſignifieth brotherly loue, the ſituation of this towne was neere the ſea in the countrey of the <hi>Lydians,</hi> and much ſubiect to earthquakes, but the Chriſtians there were ſtedfaſt in the true faith.</p>
                  <p>Touching other Churches in theſe latter dayes hereby ſet forth, one conſtantly holdeth,<note place="margin">Brightman.</note> that by this Church is figured out the moſt reformed Churches of <hi>France, Scotland, Belgia, Heluetia, Geneua, &amp;c.</hi> which haue but a little ſtrength, and are full of brotherly loue. But on the contrary ſide,<note place="margin">Viegas.</note> another giueth vas an him of the ſociety of the Ieſuites figured out here, and alleageth to this purpoſe, a prophecy of <hi>Ioachim Abbas,</hi> who liued about <hi>ann.</hi> 1200. who ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioachim Abbac de Philadelphia.</note> 
                     <hi>The Church muſt conceiue a certaine new ſpirituall vnderſtanding, or elſe an off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring ſpirituall aboue others, that is, the very order which Ieſus doth deſigne, which order indeed amiable and famous aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that went before it, ſhall be initiated in the ſixt time, &amp;c.</hi> For the firſt; I haue already ſhewed my reaſons why I doe not embrace it, where I ſpake generally of theſe ſeuen Churches: for the ſecond, it is a wonder that the Ieſuites ſo generally iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated of all the world, ſhould dote ſo much in the conceit of their owne excellency, as to intimate a conceit of any ſuch honour belonging to them, ſeeing the faith which they ſtand for, it a new, corrupt and erroneous faith; and the meanes which they vſe to propagate it, are farre differing from the maners of a <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that being all loue, they all cruelty and bloud-ſhed, and the greateſt incendiaries of kingdomes, that euer were. As for the authority produced, theſe words might as well bee vttered by the ſpirit of errour to make ſuch an abominable order the more venerable, as that groſſe errour about the Trinity was maintained by him in his booke againſt <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> wherein he denyed that the eſſence of the Trinity is one, and was therefore condemned by their owne <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell. There is a third opinion followed by moſt, that neither this, nor any other of theſe Churches are typicall, but onely in them all others of like quality are inſtructed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed and incouraged, and ſo in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> I thinke moſt properly the reformed Churches of all countreys are ſpoken vnto: for here a doore to vtter the truth, and to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:12860:155"/>it from Popiſh errors is opened, and though now, thanks be to God, our ſtrength be not contemptible, yet in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; for diuers yeeres it was but little, when the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and <hi>Wicklife</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Ierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> had this doore opened vnto them. This time was ſo long, being about foure hundred yeeres, that things being weighed with humane reaſon, it might well bee expected when it ſhould haue beene ſhut againe and neuer more bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and therefore needfull was that comfort, that none ſhould be able to ſhut it. To make a ſeparation amongſt theſe Churches for outward things, as <hi>Brightman</hi> doth, (the faith of them all being ſo conſenting, as appeareth by the harmony of our confeſſions) ſo as that <hi>Sardis</hi> ſhould figure out the <hi>German</hi> Churches following <hi>Luther, Philadelphia</hi> the <hi>Geneuan, &amp;c.</hi> following <hi>Zwinglius, Laodicea</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being more Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall, this ſeparation I ſay of thoſe, who doe all conſtantly ſtand againſt the corruptions of Popery, is vncharitable and improbable. If wee ſhould goe about to parallel Churches of after times with theſe ſeuen, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth rather ſeeme to be a fit parallel to <hi>Sardis,</hi> and ſome Iuke-warme ſtate yet for to come to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> when Popery being put down, the fire of feruency in ſtanding for the truth ſhall goe out for want of ſtirring by contentions: for whatſoeuer the indifferency of ſome particular perſons amongſt vs is, yet our State (thankes be to God) is feruent for the maintenance of the truth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, as our Parliament lawes doe declare. As for the other foure Churches, I miſlike not in ſome reſpects to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel the Primitiue Church with <hi>Epheſus</hi> &amp; <hi>Smyrna</hi> with that in the <hi>Arrians</hi> times, according to <hi>Forbs,</hi> and <hi>Brightman.</hi> But for <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> they ſeeme to ſet forth none other but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> conſidered with her Prophets, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes, the head of them being Popes Negromancers with their lying ſignes; and among them, that infamous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for whoredome, <hi>Ioane</hi> by name, which called her ſelfe <hi>Iohn,</hi> and is knowne to haue ſitten in that Chaire. For I cannot ſee how any can be more fitly compared to <hi>Balaam</hi> in <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and to <hi>Iezabel</hi> in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> than theſe.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is agreed by all, that this <hi>houre of temptation,</hi> was the time of perſecution by the heathen Emperours, from which no countrey was free.

I preferre ſtill the firſt of perſecution, but there can be no errour in this. All the time of perſecution is called but an houre, to ſhew the ſhortneſſe of it, being compared to the time of ioy afterwards in heauen.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:12860:156"/>And it is called temptation or triall, to ſhew that they needed not to feare it, as a meanes to deſtroy them, for they ſhould onely bee tried, and ſo bettered, as gold that is tried in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace and then taken out againe.

And all theſe comforts belong to euery one that cleaueth to Gods word, reſoluing to endure any thing, rather than to be beaten from it: his ſufferings ſhall be but an houre, to his triall and bettering, and his ſoule ſhall bee ſafe from all euill that might accrue vnto it thereby.</p>

For mine owne part, I am not ſatisfied with any of theſe expoſitions, vnleſſe by charity we vnderſtand the ſubſtance of grace, diffuſed ſo in the heart, as that it is truly addicted to all holy obedience, and by good workes and vnblamable life, like to that of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and as for the Eye-ſalue, all are agreed that it is ſpirituall illumination, whereby a man ſeeth the excellency of theſe things, and the vanity of temporall, being therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp in his meditations and affections with the one and contemning the other. And thus this paſſage will moſt fitly agree to this Church, for that being Chriſtian only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but wanting all zeale and care of a conuerſation ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is ſaid to be poore, naked, and blinde, poore through the want of ſoundneſſe of Religion within, naked and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed through heathen-like conditions and worldly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, blind through an ouer-eſteeming of the vaine and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things of this world, and a ſleighting of heauenly things. Wherefore if ſoundneſſe of Religion within be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and an vnblameable carriage without, and ſpirituall light
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:12860:158"/>of vnderſtanding, there will bee a full deliuerance from all this miſery. And ſoundneſſe within may well be ſet forth by the pureſt gold, becauſe as that is moſt precious of all metals, ſo this of all graces, being the very oile in the Lampe,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 1 Cor. 13.</note> and the charity, without which all is vaine, and therefore ſome are ſaid to be veſſels of gold, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20.

For the Word of God and Chriſts righteouſneſſe applyed by faith, I cannot ſee how they can ſo fitly be brought in here, ſeeing this Church is not charged to haue left the Word and expecting to be iuſtified by faith, as no Hypocrites doe, but onely faulted in remiſneſſe. Buying here is nothing but getting by prayer and ſpirituall endeuours, not for any price giuen by vs, as is expreſſed by the Prophet ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Eſay. 55.1.</note>

                  <p>Touching that ſaying, <hi>If any man open,</hi> this doth not argue a power in man to open if he will, for the opening of the heart is aſcribed vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">Act. 16.14.</note> 
                     <hi>He opened the heart of Lydia,</hi> and the whole worke and euery part of our conuerſion is from the Lord, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.26. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But man is thus ſpoken vnto,<note place="margin">Aug. de cor. &amp; grat. c. <hi>3.</hi> O homo in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, quid debes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere: in correpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one cognoſce, te tuo vitto non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere: in oratione cognoſce vnde accipias quod vis habere.</note> and <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. <hi>Turne ye, make you a new heart and a new ſpirit,</hi> that he might know what he ought to doe, hee is reproued for not doing ſo, that hee might know it to bee through his owne default, and directed to pray to God that he may be able to doe ſo, that he might know from whence he hath the power to doe ſo, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath excellently ſet it forth. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iegas</hi> a Ieſuite, vpon this place acknowledgeth, that man hath no power to open-without Gods grace preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, intimated in that he ſaith, <hi>I ſtand at the doore and knocke,</hi> by his knocking then we are awakened to open. The Lord commeth firſt with his grace vnto the will inabling it, then the will coworking with grace openeth in ſome, in others not, who being thus inabled can but will not. For this cauſe he ſaith, <hi>If any man will open,</hi> implying that it is in his power not to open. To the ſame effect <hi>Bellarmine, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de grat. &amp; lib. arbit. cap.</hi> 11. and the Councell of <hi>Trent, Seſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Can.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. But the truth is, whoſoeuer is excited by Gods knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth open vnto him, he being made willing by vertue of the ſame knocke, whoſe will before was dead to euery good motion. For in the worke of grace a man is not moued as a blocke or a ſtone, but as a liuing thing that goeth vpon the owne legs, ſo he by his will openeth to the Lord when hee hath once put life into it. And this viuifying of the will ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſo effectually to open as that it cannot but open, ſeeing as motion alwaies followeth life, ſo opening followeth the life of the free will. Doth not a man then open? hee is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly dead ſtill: is hee quickned? then hee doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly open. So that they ſeeme plainly to me to ſpeake contradictions, that ſay God by his knocke inclineth the will, from whence floweth this act of opening as a proper act
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:12860:159"/>of life, and yet the will thus inclined may reſiſt againſt God and keepe the doore ſhut ſtill, which argueth death in the will. For no man is ſo much his owne enemy, as not to flie from a deadly danger, hauing ſenſe to perceiue it, and legs to carry him away, and a paſſage open, the inſtinct of nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruatiue of it ſelfe putteth him on that he cannot but flie: in like manner, when grace commeth, there being life, and legs, and liberty, and ſenſe of the moſt deadly danger of all, the ſame grace will not ſuffer, but as an inſtinct preuaile to make a man haſten from this danger in keeping the Lord out, and let him in without delay. As for this, <hi>If any man open,</hi> from a ſuppoſition to a ſimple poſition, the conſequence is not good; If any man open, therefore ſome will not open when their doores are knockt at, it followeth no more, than (as if a man ſhould come to a priſon full of malefactors lying in great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, expecting euery day to be cut off, and ſay, I haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned liberty for you all to depart if any man will depart) it would follow that ſome would not depart and eſcape from this miſery. As for that ſaying,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>How oft would I haue gathered you together, and ye would not?</hi> it doth imply no more, but that they had meanes to bee gathered together, but through their owne corruption they preuailed not amongſt them. Moreouer, by theſe complaints and inſtigations to turne, the Lord is wont to worke a turning in ſuch as ſhall bee ſaued. Laſtly, the Lord promiſeth, <hi>If any man open, that hee will come in and ſup with him, &amp;c.</hi> This opening is by beleeuing, hee commeth in by making him his habitation: for the beleeuer is Gods Temple, and this is more than if Chriſt had come in perſon to our houſes, according to that of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. ſer. <hi>144.</hi> de Temp. plus eſt habere Chriſtum in corde quàm in domo, quia cor noſtrum interius eſt nobis, quàm domus noſtra. Pareus. Bullinger, &amp;c.</note>

                  <note place="margin">1 King 7.23.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They which by the ſea vnderſtand the word of God, expound theſe animals of the miniſters of the word in the foure parts of the world, who are full of eyes,<note place="margin">Brightman.

Now one is
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:12860:163"/>ſaid to be like a Lion, another like a calfe, &amp;c. not becauſe ſome haue one of theſe vertues onely, but hauing all theſe, as is neceſſary, they excell more in one kinde than in another, and ſo are figured out accordingly; or elſe more particularly, the holy Ghoſt would hereby expreſſe the diuers vertues of the holy miniſtery in diuers ages. In the firſt age they were bold as Lions, in preaching the Goſpell, in the ſecond age, they were ſlaughtered like oxen; in the third, as a wiſe man they diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the beaſt and the number of his name; in the fourth they mount higher, and ſee more into heauenly myſteries and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more heauenly. Theſe meditations are very plauſible, but ſeeing the foure and twenty Elders doe rather ſet forth the principall miniſters of God in all ages, I cannot ſee how theſe beaſts being diſtinct things from them, and rather leaders in ſpirituall hymnes to the praiſe of God, ſhould be the reſt of the whole company of miniſters, who are all doubtleſſe, as the reſt of the faithfull in their place inueſted with white robes, and wearing crownes vpon their heads, and not in any different forme.<note place="margin">Iren. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi> Ieron. in proem. in Matth.

And to this I ſubſcribe, both becauſe the deſcription doth ſo well agree, and the forme of praiſing God; and that which is further ſet forth <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1. where they are called animals, as here, and haue ſuch appearances, but onely that each one had theſe foure faces, whereas one here is ſaid to haue one, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other another; wherein there is no more difference, but that what was there repreſented ioyntly in each one, is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſeuerally: <hi>viz.</hi> in what maieſty the Lord ſitteth, his Chariot being drawne there, his Throne ſupported here, not onely by one kinde of creature, as is the manner of earthly Princes; but by diuers, and thoſe the chiefe made to agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to doe ſeruice vnto him: declaring hereby, how in and about his throne, and in his kingdome there is a ſweet harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and conſent, to the praiſe of his name amongſt thoſe that be of moſt different natures, as is further expreſſed, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 11.

The maine exception againſt this expoſition is, that <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.9. they are brought in together with the Elders prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God for their Redemption by the bloud of Chriſt, and therefore it ſeemeth cannot bee Angelicall ſpirits. But to this it may eaſily bee anſwered; that though the beaſts are ſaid to fall downe with the Elders, yet it doth not neceſſarily follow, that they ioyned with them in their new ſong; nay rather by ſome circumſtances it ſeemeth neceſſary to vnderſtand that muſicke and ſong to be made by the Elders only, both becauſe they could handle viols, which the beaſts could not, and the orderly performing of each ones part requireth, that as the foure beaſts had before aſcribed holineſſe to the Lord, to which the Elders ſaid <hi>Amen;</hi> So now the Elders haue ſung

As for thoſe opinions of the vertues and affections of the minde, they being no ſubſiſtences of themſelues as theſe beaſts are, they doe eaſily fall to the ground.

He was called a Lion, firſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.29.</note> for his ſtrength in ouercomming all his enemies; ſecondly, for his principality, whereby he is King of all, as the Lion is of the beaſts; thirdly, for his courage, whereby hee feareth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but maketh all afraid of him; fourthly, for his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding euen in his child-hood, as the Lion alone of all

Seuen eyes ſet forth the fulneſſe of ſpirituall light comming from him, as all Expoſitors agree. If it ſhall ſeeme ſtrange that Chriſt ſhould appeare as a Lambe with ſeuen hornes to declare his kingly power, ſeeing the Lambe is a weake creature, and hath little ſtrength in the hornes; I anſwer, that it was neceſſary he being ſet forth as a Sacrifice for our ſinnes, whereby they were taken away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe an obſtacle to the perception of diuine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, hornes in great number ſhould be aſcribed vnto him to declare his might yet remaining when hee had ſuffered, leſt his enemies ſhould contemne him as a weakling. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though two hornes, which Lambs vſually haue, were vnfit to ſet forth this, yet ſeuen hornes doe fitly ſet forth an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Lambe, mighty, beyond the nature of that beaſt. And the ſeuen eyes anſwer to the ſeuen Seales, ſo that he hath eyes enow to ſee what is vnder euery ſeale.</p>

It is comfort enough to vs in reſpect of the Saints in Heauen, that they beare ſtill an intire loue towards vs, and by ſoliciting the Lord for vs, ſeeke to further our happineſſe, and that their prayers in this kinde are gratefull as odours, and ſo are all our owne godly prayers.

Yet euen they that vnderſtand this of hereſie, expound it of a famine of hearing of the word of God, allegorically ſet forth vnder the termes of wheat and barley. For they ſay, that hereſie commeth with ballances, pretending to weigh euery doctrine by the weight of truth; but the Lord giueth warning, that true doctrine and good tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhall then bee very ſcarce, yet the fundamentall points meant by the wine and oyle ſhall remaine vnſhaken.

For mine owne part, I am not ſatisfied with any of theſe expoſitions, and therefore deſire a can did interpretation, if I ſhall put in my coniecture. I thinke then, that the voice in the midſt of the foure beaſts, is the voice of the cryer of this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riding vpon the blacke horſe; for each horſe commeth out from amidſt the beaſts, ſeeing the booke, at the opening whereof they all appeare, is held by the Lambe in the midſt of the beaſts, as was before ſhewed. That which he crieth, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plenty nor ſcarcity, but as hee maketh ſhew, that rideth by his ballances, a iuſt and equall price of theſe neceſſary graines, and becauſe wine and oyle are not wont to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ballance, men are ſecured, that they ſhall not bee herein wronged; and theſe are mentioned as the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of thoſe countreys, whereby the life is maintained, according to the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.</note> 
                  <hi>He giueth the ſtaffe of bread, wine to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:12860:170"/>make glad the heart of man, and oyle to make him a chearefull countenance.</hi> Now in all this it is alluded vnto the doctrine of truth, the hereticke profeſſeth to teach nothing but what hee can approue for truth, being weighed by the ballance of holy Scriptures, and euen as in buying and ſelling, they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted honeſt dealers that ſell a peny worth for a peny, and make no mixtures in their liquid commodities, but ſerue the buyer of them pure and vnhurt by ſuch mixing, ſo he ſeeketh to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his dealing in the teaching of his hereſies, by profeſſing equity and iuſtice and freedome from all deceit, and if his corne ſhall be thought ſomewhat deare, hee will make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in his wine and oile: for it is not vnuſuall to compare diuine inſtructions to corne, and ſometime to milke and wine. Thus it appeareth what tragicall times the Church hath had, but it is by Gods owne appointment, and the laſt hath now beene long in acting, neither ſhall wee need to feare profeſſed enemies vnto Chriſt any more: for wait but a while, till the preſent corruptions be purged out, and then commeth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with Chriſt when there ſhall be nothing to annoy vs, and in the meane ſeaſon the comfort is, that of all theſe riders the truth onely weareth the crowne; wherefore perſecutors, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and corrupt Chriſtians ſhall be put downe, and ſuch as imbrace the truth, ſhall reigne finally in glory for euer.</p>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this it is agreed, that the apparitions paſt, being but dumb repreſentations, it was neceſſary that by ſome voyce <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould be excited to behold them; but here the ſoules appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring make a cry themſelues, which is enough to ſtirre vp to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and therefore no other preparing voyce was needfull:
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:12860:170"/>and the like may bee ſaid of the ſixt ſeale, ſuch things were acted, and with ſuch noiſe, that it was in ſtead of an exciting voyce.</p>

And whereas ſacrifices are wont to bee laid vpon the Altar, not vnder it; the reaſon why they are ſaid to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be, becauſe they were not now in ſacrificing, but had been already ſacrificed, and therfore as the aſhes of the ſacrifice being burnt, fall thorow a grate vnder the Altar, ſo they are ſaid to lie vnder.</p>

               <p>Some expound the Altar, of Chriſts humanity,<note place="margin">Bernard. ſerm. <hi>4.</hi> Omnium ſanct.</note> which the faithfull are receiued vnto now, it being reſerued till the laſt day, to giue them the full fruition of his diuinity alſo.</p>
               <p>Some by the Altar vnderſtand the places of the martyrs bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall or ſufferings,<note place="margin">Ribera.

But this is a meere Ieſuiticall imagination, ſeeing Altars vpon martyrs ſepulchres were of a later edition, and though ſo many men be often called ſo many ſoules, yet when the ſoules of any that are ſlaine are named, it cannot bee ſo taken. Whereas moſt ſtand for Chriſt meant by the Altar, I ſhould willingly incline to thinke ſo to, but that Chriſt yet ſtandeth as a Lambe, and therefore I cannot ſee how he can at the ſame time bee repreſented by an Altar alſo. I conclude therefore as I began, that by the appearance of an Altar, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented their ſacrificing, when they ſuffered, the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:12860:171"/>they now are, being heauen the common receptacle of all faithfull ſoules; but ſaid to bee vnder the Altar, to denote the manner of their death; neither doth <hi>Iohn</hi> ſee them with his bodily eyes, but being in the ſpirit. And fidy doe the ſoules of the martyred appeare after ſuch a number ſlaine by cruell enemies, crying for vengeance; not vocally, for ſoules doe not vtter voyces, but vertually; the deſtroying and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of them hauing a loud cry in the eares of God, ſo that a deſire of reuenge in them is amiſſe ſurmiſed to bee from hence, who being in the fleſh had ſo much loue, as that they prayed for their perſecutors, and were farre from the ſpirit of reuenge. But they are brought in crying aloud for the terrour of perſecutors, ſeeing the cryes of ſuch ſhall without doubt bee regarded, though in reſpect of many more yet in theſe times of corruption to bee crowned alſo with martyrdome a delay to bemade; Whereupon it is, that their anſwer is alſo ſet forth in this manner. And thus I haue briefly reſolued the reſt of the doubts without delaying the reader: by the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of expoſitions,<note place="margin">Pareus. Brightman. Chryſoſt.

Serm. <hi>30.</hi> detemp.</note> ſome interpreting their cry for reuenge, to be onely for deliuerance of the Church from perſecutors, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene already ſo long oppreſſed: and ſome for the taking away of this malice out of mens mindes that there may bee no more perſecuting, by confounding ſuch Kings and Potentates, that they may bee brought to turne vnto Chriſt. The white robes giuen vnto them,<note place="margin">Bullinger. Brightman.</note> howſoeuer ſome contend that they were ſignes of ſome comfort, and breathing time which the Church ſhould haue and had about this time, according to their expoſition; yet both the plaine ſpeech which is vſed in anſwering them is againſt it, for they are told of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that muſt be ſlaine alſo, and white robes are neuer ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this ſenſe,<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> but to ſet forth heauenly glory, which is not to be thought now firſt to haue been giuen vnto them, but immediatly vpon their departure out of this life, when their deaths began firſt to cry, though it was not repreſented in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion till now; ſo that euen when they cry, they are in the midſt of heauenly ioyes, and without all paſſion of ſorrow; onely they are not perfectly glorified, till the whole company being made vp at the day of iudgement, being reunited to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:12860:171"/>they ſhall reigne in heauen for euer; wherefore they are bidden reſt till their fellow ſeruants were ſlaine alſo. And well doth this cry come in after the fourth ſeale, repreſenting the corruptions in the Church fighting againſt the truth, becauſe this perſecution hath beene longer than any before it, and therefore needfull it was to tell of martyrs which had beene already made crying out, and of ſuch as ſhould yet bee made, when it might ſeeme to bee full time to put an end to theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, that expecting ſo long a continuance, wee might arme our ſelues with patience.</p>

And being brought to this eſtate of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as there can be no ſound peace, but terrors of conſcience out of the truth, ſo all eſtates are ſet forth as terrified by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Gods iudgement, and ſome indeed fulfilled this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter, going into wilderneſſes and Monaſteries,

But I ſubſcribe to the firſt expoſition, becauſe moſt agreeable to the letter, and where the literall ſenſe may ſtand, there is no vſe of allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And indeed without ſtraining, no time but the day of iudgement can be rightly called the great day of Gods wrath, wherein all the wicked of all eſtates and degrees are filled with terrour at Gods preſence. If it bee taken as an allegory, there are ſo great differences, that there will bee no certainty of truth: Beſides that it doth no way anſwer the precedent cry for vengeance ſo fitly, as being literally vnderſtood of the laſt day: for whatſoeuer commotions there be in ſtates and kingdomes, yet euery one is not at ſuch times ſo ſeuerely animaduerted againſt, but many eſcape, whereas here euery one is ſaid to tremble and feare. Whereas <hi>Pareus</hi> includeth both the perſecution vnder Antichriſt and the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, I cannot ſee how that can ſtand; for the fleeing away of all eſtates and degrees for feare is an effect of thoſe ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious accidents in heauen and in earth, as in reaſon it is likely when ſuch things ſhall come to paſſe, no leſſe can be expected but horrible feare.

               <p>For mine owne part, when I conſider the premiſes of great and horrible miſeries to come vpon the world, I cannot but thinke as I intimated before in generall, that comfort againſt theſe euils is here intended to the godly, and therefore I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe rather to thoſe that vnderſtand theſe things literally of foure Angels appointed by God as his Miniſters herein (for it is ſaid, <hi>To them it is giuen to hurt, &amp;c.</hi>) to deſtroy all things,<note place="margin">Arethas. Ribera.

Neither can I ſee why by the ſtrong Angell out of the Eaſt ſhould bee meant Chriſt, who ſtood yet as a Lambe in the midſt of the Throne, and this is not the firſt time that a ſtrong Angell is ſpoken of, for <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. a ſtrong Angell proclaimeth, <hi>Who can open the Booke. &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore, as I take it, he is an Angell indeed who is ſaid to be ſtrong, for ſo is euery Angell, and hee commeth vp out of the Eaſt, that being the riſing place of all heauenly bodies, the Sunne, Moone and Staries; and the lightning is ſaid by our Sauiour to come out of the Eaſt, and the old man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhipping, and ſo their expectation of comfort was
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:12860:174"/>from the Eaſt: as for his commanding theſe Angels, it was not through his owne power ouer them, but hauing commiſſion from the higheſt ſo do doe; and as he had a commiſſion to come with the ſeale, ſo they were fellow Miniſters of God with him, which is intimated in that he biddeth them not to hurt any thing <hi>till we haue ſealed the ſeruants of God in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,</hi> ſpeaking in the plurall number, as ioyning them with himſelfe. I conceiue then that by theſe foure Angels holding the foure winds, are ſet forth thoſe Miniſters of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who for the ſinnes of the world ſhould deſtroy all things: euill angels I cannot thinke them to be, no more than the Angels deſtroying <hi>Sodome,</hi> eſpecially becauſe as I haue already ſaid, they are aſſociated vnto the Angell with the ſeale of God. Now being appointed to this ſeruice, they beginne to doe accordingly, but euen when they put their hands to it they are ſtayed for a time, as thoſe warriors, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9. <hi>Till the ſeruants of God were ſealed in their foreheads,</hi> in token of Gods ſingular care ouer them in the midſt of thoſe common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo as that their ſaluation ſhould not be hereby hindred; though outwardly they did participate with others in worldly miſeries, yet there was a difference in that they haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Gods Seale vnto ſaluation, which others want, being left void of all true comfort to the rage of theſe grieuous trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And thus one obiection againſt this expoſition is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if outward deſtructions be meant here, then the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God are in vaine ſealed, becauſe they had their ſhare in theſe as deeply as any other: no, it is not in vaine, but for their comfort and aſſurance of ſafety in reſpect of their beſt good. As for the time when this deſtruction of things ſhould be made, it is not onely at the laſt when there ſhall be an end put to all things here, but alſo in all the tract of time from hence till then: for by reaſon of perſecutions and ſinnes there haue beene many times mortalities and deſtructions brought vpon the world; ſo that it is not neceſſary that all muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be deſtroied ſo ſoone as the ſeruants of God were ſealed, becauſe they are bidden to forbeare till they were ſealed: for hereby rather is ſet forth that though the Lord being much prouoked is fully bent to execute his iudgements, yet the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:12860:174"/>prime and chiefe thing in his care is to preſerue his Elect, and then ſecondarily, he will ſee to the taking of due reuenge vpon the wicked world: and thus another obiection againſt this expoſition is alſo anſwered, that it cannot ſtand, becauſe the ſeruants of God doe reigne with Chriſt after their ſealing a thouſand yeeres before the day of iudgement commeth, which how ſhould it be, if the deſtroying of all be ſtayed, but till the ſealing be paſt: for neither is this deſtruction to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the laſt, nor yet doth it neceſſarily follow, becauſe the ſeruants of God are firſt ſealed, and no execution muſt bee done till then, that this execution muſt needs be done imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after, but onely it is firſt prouided for their ſafety againſt this time whenſoeuer it commeth. And whereas it is further obiected, that it is not likely that this booke being ſo myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſhould ſet forth things ſo plainely, as that by winds, ſhould be meant winds, &amp;c. againſt <hi>Viegas</hi> whoſe obiection this is, I oppoſe the reaſon of <hi>Ribera,</hi> that yet we muſt not goe from the letter but in caſe of neceſſity, when the place cannot beare the literall ſenſe, as here we haue ſhewed that it well may.

This reſolution, I confeſſe, is very ingenious and holy: but for ſo much as the diuerſity of peoples ſealed ſeemeth rather to bee intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe tribes, euery one differring from another, and not the ſeuerall ſteps of grace, by which the ſeruants of God paſſe on to glory: I rather incline to that country-man of ours,<note place="margin">Brightman.</note> who hath beene moſt induſtrious about this Reuelation, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this order of the order of diuers nations cleaning to the true ſaith of Chriſt, being conſidered according to their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South; for ſo we ſhall finde the dwellings of theſe tribes to haue beene as that they which firſt were famous for the truth of the Goſpell held faſt amongſt them, anſwer to <hi>Iudah,</hi> and ſo others.

After this, the true Church appeared not in any certaine place, but lay hid, as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> dwelt ſcattered amongſt the reſt of the Tribes.

For firſt, he appeareth ſtill as a Lambe; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is ſaid to be but another Angell; thirdly, Odours are giuen vnto him, as Trumpets to the reſt, intimating an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity betwixt them; fourthly, that the Prieſt, the Altar, and the Cenſer, ſhould be all one, it ſeemeth very improbable; fiftly, the prayers of the Saints are ſpoken of by the ſame phraſe that <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. where the foure and twenty Elders are ſaid to haue <hi>golaon Vials full of Odours, which are the prayers of the Saints.</hi> Where by the prayers of the Saints, their praiſing of God in Heauen, and praying for our good in generall being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and not the prayers of the godly vpon earth, why ſhould it not be vnderſtood here likewiſe? I thinke then, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe is here meant, but as before any viſion of future things a preparation was made thereunto by a repreſentation of Gods Maieſty, and of the Lambe delighted in the deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his ſeruants as in a ſweet perſume, but terrible to the wicked, and therefore iſſued thunders, lightnings, and voices from before him: ſo now the ſecond particular viſion being prepared vnto, it is ſet forth in the figure of this Angell, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the Altar and offering Odours with the prayers of the Saints which come vp before God, how acceptable the ſeruice is which by the godly is done vnto God; and in the fire taken and caſt vpon the earth, producing voices, thunders, &amp;c. how terrible he will be to the wicked of this world. For the Altar and Cenſer, it is beyond the intent of this place particularly to deſcant vpon them, the ſeruice which is done vnto God being doubtleſſe thus ſet forth in alluſion to the old manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:12860:179"/>In the former repreſentation, Prayers are called O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, here Odours are added vnto them, Odours to Odours to ſhew yet further their extraordinary ſweetneſſe: their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and thunders, &amp;c. iſſue forth, here is ſhewed by what meanes, <hi>viz.</hi> coales taken from the Altar, ſignifying that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the holy fire with ſweet Odours maketh a pleaſant ſmell, yet without Odours it yeeldeth a thundring and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying noiſe, the wicked that pray not can expect nothing but terrour and affrighting from the Lord, who is moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the godly, frequenting him with their prayers.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:12860:179"/>and bad Chriſtians gathered together from the reſt of the world; of which the bad, which are the third part, are burnt vp, that is, periſh by Gods iuſt iudgement, and are called trees becauſe of their inſtabilitie in times of winds, and graſſe for their frailtie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ranke of Preachers ſet forth by the ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, where the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles in the next age, againſt whom the Deuill, as a great burning mountaine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and the third part of the ſea is turned into bloud by the deſtruction of the faithfull, the fiſhes die by the reuolting of the wauering, and many teachers who as ſhips had carried on others, through the greatneſſe of the perſecution fall away.</p>
               <p>The third ranke ſet forth by the third Angell, are the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the next age, to trouble whom Heretikes riſe vp, theſe are the Star falling from Heauen, giuing light in times paſt; but now making bitter, by their hereticall doctrine, the fountaines of holy Scriptures and the riuers of the Fathers, by corrupting them to maintaine their hereſies thereby.</p>
               <p>The fourth ranke ſet forth by the fourth Angell, are the Preachers of theſe laſt times, who are troubled by Hypocrites and falſe Prophets, that vnder a pretext of holineſſe broach new opinions, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that a good part of the true knowledge of Chriſt is obſcured, which is the darkning of the Sunne to the third part; and the true Church, which is the Moone, much diſtminiſhed; and the Doctors, which are the Starres, giue not ſo cleare light through this meanes as before.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Eutiches</hi> darkned the third part of the Sunne, by reaching that there was but one nature in Chriſt, obſcuring thus his Diuinity. <hi>Bullinger</hi> differing ſomewhat from this, maketh the firſt Angels ſounding to be in the time of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarens,</hi> and <hi>Hebionites,</hi> who maintained that iuſtification was not by faith onely, but partly by the Law, the haile of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine being thus mingled with the fire of pretended zeale.

               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:12860:180"/>

               <p>Laſtly, not to weary the Reader with more varieties, ſome vnderſtand the iudgemets of God at foure ſpeciall times exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vpon the Iewes and wicked Heathen for perſecuting the Church and ſeruants of God: firſt,<note place="margin">Fox.</note> the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> ſecondly, a fearefull peſtilence waſting many Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the time of <hi>Antoninus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erus,</hi> a bloody perſecutor, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and warres thorowout all the Eaſt,<note place="margin">Beda.

Thirdly, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence of ten whole yeeres raging all ouer the world in the daies of <hi>Galitenus,</hi> who together with his father <hi>Valerianus,</hi> had beene a moſt bloudy perſecutor.

                  <note place="margin">Pomponius.</note> and hauing conſumed the people in the ſouth, it ſpred into the Eaſt, and other parts of the world, exhauſting the greateſt part of the inhabitants, and leauing ſome places altogether without inhabitants.

                  <note place="margin">Euſebius. Sabellicus.</note> ſo as it was not a long time before. <hi>Cilicia, Syria, Cappadocia,</hi> were waſted by the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

Then they would giue their moſt precious things for a little food, and ſelling their poſſeſſions for food, became
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:12860:181"/>very poore. Some are graſſe and hurtfull weeds, and ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble women went out of Cities into the country to beg. Some going about like ſhadowes ready to fall here and there, ſtretching out their hands craued ſomething to be giuen to them, who were ready to die for hunger, and the ſtreets and market-places lay full of dead bodies, there being none to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them. And ſuch of the wealthier ſort as eſcaped the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the famine, were conſumed by the Peſtilence. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the irruptions of the <hi>Vandals, Goths, Longobards,</hi> and of other barbarous people into the Eaſt and Weſt, from the yeeres 475. deſtroying the Emperours, and preuailing till the time of <hi>Carolus Magnus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt ſo many varieties it is hard to determine. But ſeeing it is moſt apparant, that the iudgements which ſhould come vpon the wicked world are here figured out, in that vnder the fift Trumpet they only are ſaid to be hurt by the Locuſts, who had not the ſeale of God in their foreheads; and vnder the ſixt, that notwithſtanding all which they ſuffered, they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not of their idolatries and murthers, &amp;c. whence it may be more than probably gathered, that the foure firſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets tend to the ſetting forth of the like. I cannot aſſent to their expoſitions, which apply theſe things either to perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or hereſies, or hypocriſies, or to the degrees by which Antichriſt aroſe. And ſeeing the purpoſe of theſe viſions is not to ſhew things paſt, but to come, that expoſition referring the great iudgements of former ages hither, is to bee reiected. I doe therefore partly aſſent to the laſt expoſition, applying theſe terrible euents vpon the ſounding of theſe foure Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, vnto the grieuous puniſhments inflicted vpon wicked perſecutors, at foure moſt remarkable times: firſt, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Ieruſalem; ſecondly, in the time of <hi>Antonius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> thirdly, of <hi>Galienus;</hi> fourthly, of <hi>Diocleſianus.</hi> For whereas he maketh the two laſtone, and bringeth in the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Goths for the fourth; I hold, that there being ſuch a diſtance of almoſt forty yeeres, there ſhould be a diſtinction of theſe iudgements alſo. But how doe theſe apparitions agree to theſe iudgements, being almoſt euery one alike, the Sword, Famine, and Peſtilence, where as in the figures firſt there is
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:12860:181"/>haile, and fire, and bloud vpon earth, then a burning moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in the ſea, &amp;c. euery one differing greatly from another? I anſwer, that the Lord did not reſpect ſo much the diuerſity of euils to come, as the number of them and the greatneſſe, able to make all men to turne their eyes to behold and bee amazed at them. And more particularly, theſe are made choiſe of to ſet them forth after the manner of the Prophets, who are wont to allude vnto ſome remarkable Hiſtory of things paſt, in foretelling of things to come, though they be not of the very ſame kinde: for vpon the Egyptians theſe things were done almoſt according to the letter, there was haile and fire ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, their Riuers were ſo ſmitten, as that they could not drinke of them without dying, there was darkneſſe of three dayes and three nights; and finally, the red Sea like bloud, falling vpon them as a huge mountaine, became their deſtruction, being like fiſhes tumbled vp and downe in the deepe. To ſhew then that theſe profeſſed enemies and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Chriſtianity ſhould be deſtroyed by Gods Iudgements, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyptians were, theſe figures are taken vp, and becauſe they had many waies to torment Chriſtians, the Lord ſheweth that they alſo ſhould be plagued many waies, and be deſtroyed with ſtrange iudgements before vnheard of. For it is Gods manner to puniſh ſinners in their kinde; the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, who burnt with ſtrange luſts, with a burning fire from Heauen; the builders of Babel, who ſought them a name, with confuſion; and the enemies of the Chriſtian Religion, who ſought out ſtrange tortures, with a burning mountaine and worme-wooddy Starre, &amp;c. iudgements ſtrange and terble. And the third part of the Sea, and the third part of trees, &amp;c. are ſaid to bee affected with theſe iudgements as I thinke, becauſe it was but a third part of the whole world where theſe tragedies were acted, if the parts vnknowne till of late, and yet vnknowne be conſidered.</p>

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:12860:183"/>There are ſome differences in reſoluing this deſcription, but all ſpeake almoſt to this effect.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:12860:184"/>all theſe expoſitions, I finde that moſt of our ſide preferre the firſt, touching the Pope and his religions, and many things in the deſcription doe fit ſo well that I would gladly ioyne with them, but that I am reſolued vpon ſuch reaſons as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet downe, that not corruptions in Religion, but plagues comming vpon the world therefore are here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.

If then any great iudgement which may be fitted to this deſcription, can be found out in the time of the Arrian hereſie, it ſeemes moſt reaſonable to me that this ſhould be held to be the figure thereof. For it is not likely, that when the Lord is ſo carefull in ſetting downe the iudgements to come vpon the heathen perſecutors and vpon the Antichriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the middle time bringing the Church to ſo great miſery, and therefore moſt remarkably puniſhed certaine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of yeeres together ſhould be paſſed ouer in ſilence, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it is if we finde not out ſomething agreeing vnto it vnder this fifth Trumpet. I hold therefore with <hi>Lyra, Rupertus,</hi> and ſome others, that here is a deſcription of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> a baſe and ignoble people, and in times paſt without name, leaping about like Locuſts to make a prey of other mens poſſeſſions, and by their huge ſwarmes and multitudes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing where they came to the bringing of all things to ruine.

And after this, partly in <hi>Affrike,</hi> and partly in <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> euen almoſt all ouer the Chriſtian world, they were moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſcourges ſent for a plague vpon the Hereſies which were moſt rife in thoſe times,<note place="margin">Victor. vticenfis.</note> and chiefly that of <hi>Arrius.</hi> And this plague continued breaking out oft times more violently the ſpace of about 184. yeeres from the firſt to the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> till <hi>ann.</hi> 550. in which time, when they gat the victory, no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of barbarous cruelty was ſpared, in ſo much as Writers

Some were ſent into baniſhment, and if through infirmity any could not keepe pace with the reſt, they were faſtened to the tailes of horſes, and dragged againſt the ſtones till they were pitteouſly rent and torne. Some were compelled to carry vnreaſonable burthens, and if being oppreſſed with the weight they went ſlowly, they were whipt with whips full of iron prickes, that put them to exceeding great torment. Then they which before had beene rulers of the world, were made ſlaues vnto a barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> was compelled by them to deueſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his imperiall robes, and to goe into baniſhment; the Empire in the Weſt being thence forward ruled by <hi>Odoacer</hi> the King of the <hi>Rugians,</hi> and <hi>Theodoricus</hi> of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and his ſucceſſors, till that <hi>Etius</hi> being ſent by the Emperour of the Eaſt, cut them quite off from hauing any dominion more. And yet neither then were they free from the oppreſſion of ſtrangers, for the <hi>Longobards</hi> brought in by the ſaid <hi>Etius,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Kingdome of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ruled for the ſpace of aboue two hundred yeeres, till the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great. All which Hiſtory, that it may be vnderſtood the better, I haue thought good to tranſcribe hither as I finde it to haue beene by others collected together. I haue already touched <hi>Valens</hi> his bringing in of the <hi>Goths</hi> into the Eaſt to his owne ruine about <hi>ann.</hi> 380. After him reigned <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſixteene yeeres, all which time that ſauage Nation was able to doe no great hurt. But in the daies of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius,</hi> they came in great multitudes, eſpecially into the weſt where <hi>Honorius</hi> reigned. For <hi>Radagiſus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> came in the eighteenth yeere of his reigne into <hi>Italy,</hi> with 200000. men <hi>ann.</hi> 409. but this great multitude being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and periſhing by famine, he came to a miſerable end: but fiue yeeres after, <hi>Alaricus</hi> who ſucceeded him, beſieged and tooke <hi>Rome</hi> and ſpoiled it and the reſt of <hi>Italy. Adaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſucceeded him, and tooke <hi>Rome</hi> the ſecond time. After him <hi>Genſcricus</hi> came with 500000. and tooke <hi>Rome</hi> the third time, <hi>ann.</hi> 445. After this, <hi>Odoacer</hi> King of the <hi>Rugians</hi> tooke <hi>Rome,</hi> and quite ouerthrew the Empire, reigning in <hi>Italy</hi>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:12860:185"/>fourteene yeeres. Againſt him came <hi>Theodoricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> ſent by <hi>Zeno</hi> Emperour of the Eaſt, who ouercomming him, reigned in <hi>Italy</hi> three and thirty yeeres. <hi>Atalaricus</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him and reigned eight yeeres: then <hi>Theodatus</hi> two yeeres, and he being depoſed, <hi>Vitiges</hi> was made King, and reigned fiue yeeres; he being taken priſoner by <hi>Belliſarius,</hi> a Captaine ſent by <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> Emperour of the Eaſt, <hi>Totilas</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; vnder whom, and <hi>Vitiges</hi> his predeceſſor, <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> indured infinite miſeries. <hi>Totilas</hi> tooke <hi>Rome</hi> the fifth time and razed it to the ground, burning all with fire four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes together, and ſo the Citizens being left harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, wandred about the fields of <hi>Campania,</hi> hee reigned ten yeeres; and then <hi>Etius,</hi> another famous Captaine being ſent againſt him, he was ouercome, and an end was put to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Goths.</hi> Theſe times being computed together from the eighteenth yeere of <hi>Honorius,</hi> when theſe Locuſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne firſt to ſwarme in <hi>Italy</hi> vnder <hi>Radagiſus,</hi> vnto <hi>Totilas</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> will appeare to be about 150 yeeres. For the eighteenth yeere of <hi>Honorius,</hi> when <hi>Radagiſus</hi> came, was the fourth of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> of the Eaſt, who reigned 38. yeeres after; <hi>Martianus</hi> 7. <hi>Leo</hi> 17. <hi>Zeno</hi> 17. vnder whoſe reigne <hi>Odoacer</hi> beganne and reigned 14. yeeres, <hi>Theodoricus</hi> 33. <hi>Atalaricus</hi> 8. <hi>Theodatus</hi> more than 2. <hi>Vitiges</hi> 5. an <hi>inter regnum</hi> after that <hi>Belliſarius</hi> had ouerthrowne <hi>Vitiges</hi> 2. <hi>Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> 10. From <hi>Radagiſus</hi> then to the end of <hi>Zenoes</hi> reigne are 80. yeeres, when the Roman Empire was put downe in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtulus,</hi> which time I reckon by the eaſterne Emperours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that after <hi>Honorius,</hi> who reigned 29. yeeres, <hi>Valentmian</hi> the third onely reigned 30. yeeres, but after him there were many which ſtood ſo ſhort a time, and were ſo vnhappy in their reignes, as that their times are not counted, as namely <hi>Auitus, Richimex, Maioranus, Senerus, Anthemius, Olibrius, Gliceri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now it is to be noted, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of theſe ſtrangers was ſome yeeres before the end of <hi>Zenoes</hi> Empire before ſpoken of, and the time of <hi>Theodatus</hi> might be two or three yeeres more than are reckoned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:12860:185"/>we may deduct out of this ſome fiue or ſix yeeres, becauſe this change was vnder <hi>Zeno,</hi> and ſo the time will be 148. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which if we adde againe the foreſaid two or three, the whole will be about 150. from <hi>ann.</hi> 409. to <hi>ann.</hi> 559. This ground being thus laid, all things will moſt excellently agree to theſe troubles. For firſt the Deuill, who is a murtherer from the beginning, in times paſt a <hi>Lucifer,</hi> but fallen, is by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for a puniſhment of hereſie to bring in an infinite multitude of ſtrangers, and this is his opening of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit, becauſe the purpoſe of ſpoiling, waſting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying is from hell. Theſe are compared to Locuſts, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the aire through their multitude, as in <hi>Egypt,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no certaine place of habitation, but preyed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, and becauſe they were not of any great power to hurt, but by reaſon of their great multitudes. They hurt like Scorpions, becauſe when <hi>Valens</hi> firſt brought them in, they came as helpers, but after a while they proued moſt miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to Chriſtendome; as the Scorpion looketh pleaſantly, and putteth to no paine at the firſt, till after three daies, when the torments of his ſtinging are moſt grièuous and kill, for which cauſe alſo their ſting is ſaid to be in their taile. Yet there is a difference from the Scorpions ſting, in that theſe only torment and kill not, and torment ſuch onely as want the marke of God in their forehead. For though many in theſe warres were ſlaine, yet the Empire was but wounded as it were, and not for euer deſtroyed, ſeeing after a certaine time it reuiued againe. And it is the ſtate in generall whereof it is ſpoken, when he ſaith, That they ſhould not kill, but torment them. As for the exception of the ſealed ones, whereas it may ſeeme that they were hurt moſt, for ſo much as the Orthodox were moſt pereſecuted by the <hi>Goths,</hi> being partly after a time drawne to be Arrians. This exception I take it, is made to note that ſuch as were not ſealed, but turned away after Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, were the cauſe of this miſchiefe, neither could the Elect receiue any dammage hereby, ſeeing all outward calamities ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for Gods ſake are turned to an inward aduantage vnto them. The time of fiue moneths being reſolued into daies, is iuſt the foreſaid terme of 150. yeeres, a yeere being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:12860:186"/>by a day, as is frequent in propheſies. It may alſo bee applied vnto the fiue times of <hi>Romes</hi> vanquiſhment in the compaſſe of theſe yeeres. The ſtate being thus often ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and they who were wont to bee Lords of all into ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude reduced, their houſes fired, their wiues rauiſhed, their riches comming into the poſſeſſion of others, and themſelues expoſed to extreme pouerty and want, harbourleſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe, no maruell though they deſired rather to die, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting no end of theſe miſeries. To ſhew the warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their comming, they are further likened to horſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto the battell; to ſhew the ſoueraignty to which they attained, Crownes like gold are aſcribed vnto them, to ſhew that they were no true Locuſts, but onely of their quality and condition, they are ſaid to haue the faces of men, and the haire of women to ſhew their barbarouſneſſe, and the teeth of Lions for their deuouring and cruell tearing in peeces, none being able to withſtand them in their time. Their iron breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates ſhew their might, their wings their ſwift and ſudden comming, their noiſe their hideouſneſſe in their comming. Their terme of fiue months is againe repeated, to make the Allegory taken from true Locuſts to hold the better, ſeeing this is the whole terme of their life, as hath beene already ſhewed, and therefore it is ſet forth by months, and not by daies. The Angell of the bottomleſſe pit, a murtherer and deſtroyer, is ſaid to be their King, to note out by whoſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation they came forth, and vnder whoſe banner they fought, although God vſed them herein as inſtruments to execute his iuſt iudgements. And thus I haue by Gods grace fitted a moſt kindly expoſition to this moſt hard and myſticall paſſage. Whence we may ſee; that beſides ordinary, God hath vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected waies to plague wickedneſſe withall, and to abate the pride of thoſe that are moſt potent and thinke themſelues moſt ſecure. And whoſoeuer are the inſtruments to execute Gods will in this kinde, can doe nothing no longer time than he permitteth them. And howſoeuer the godly being mixt with others partake in outward miſeries, yet nothing ſhall be able to hurt them, God hauing a ſpeciall care at theſe times ouer them, ſo that they haue wherein to reioyce when all
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:12860:186"/>things are confounded; for no hurt, which is an hurt indeed, can come to them, ſeeing theſe outward things are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and as the ſuperfluous haires of the head, in loſing whereof there is no detriment, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeake.</p>

The voyce which was heard ſpeaking to the ſixt Angell from amongſt the foure hornes of the Altar, is by the conſent of all, the voyce of the Lord Ieſus, who had ſuffered, and was ſacrificed for our ſins: he vttereth his voice, not from the midſt of the throne, where he ſtood, but from the midſt of the Altar, vnder which it is ſaid before, the ſoules lay crying for reuenge; to ſhew, that their cries were heard and preuailed to the producing of the grieuous euils following. They were anſwered before by ſignes, for the Angell tooke coales from the Altar and threw them downe to the earth, whence inſued thunders, lightnings, and earthquakes: but now by a liuely voyce commanding to looſe the foure Angels bound at <hi>Euphrates,</hi> who ſtood alwayes ready at an houre, day, moneth or yeere, that they might goe forth to kill, and deſtroy, and come vpon theſe groſſe corrupters of religion with innumerable and inuincible armies of <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turkes.</hi>

               <p>Touching his loud cry, and the ſeuen thunders hereupon vttering their voyces, which <hi>Iohn</hi> muſt not write; theſe things ſerue further to declare the terrour of this meſſenger ſent from heauen: for when the Lion roareth, the beaſts of the forreſt tremble, ſo when this Angell is ſet forth roaring ſo loud that a thundering noiſe reboundeth againe from the ſound of his voyce, the Lord would haue men to tremble at it, and repent, and turne to the Lord from their ſinnes, wherein they are
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:12860:191"/>noted hitherto to haue perſiſted. The things vttered by the thunders the Lord will not haue written, becauſe in all likelihood they were copiouſly ſet forth in other parts of holy Scripture, nothing being more frequent than to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh to repent, and to threaten the impenitent. And the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are ſaid to be ſeuen, which is a number of perfection, to ſhew that many terrours ſhould come vpon the world, if haply they would be rouzed vp hereby.

What they vtter muſt not be written, becauſe there are ſome myſteries which ſhould not be knowne now,<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> but are reſerued for after times. <hi>Pareus,</hi> as he referreth all things here in common to all the ſix trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets before going, as matter of conſolation to the godly, ſo hee vnderſtandeth the miniſters in the time of perſecution, who did not forbeare to vtter their thundring voyces againſt Tyrants, though vnto deafe eares; which is noted, in that <hi>Iohn</hi> is forbidden to write: for when any thing is ſpoken or writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but not regarded, it is as if it were not written.

               <p>The Papiſts generally grounding vpon the opinion of the ancients, referre all to Antichriſts time,<note place="margin">Irenaeus. Iuſtin. Martyr. Cyprian. Ierom. Baſil.

Yea, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith plainly,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.7.</note> that the myſterie of iniquity did then worke.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Antichriſtianiſme is a myſterie that is ſo couertly carried, that Antichriſt can hardly be diſcerned when hee is come,<note place="margin">Bullinger. Fox. Pareus.

               <p n="2">2. But touching the outercourt there is difference in the reading. <hi>Pareus</hi> following <hi>Luther,</hi> and the copies of <hi>Robert
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:12860:193"/>Stephanus,</hi> readeth it the inner Court, but <hi>Arethas</hi> the outer, and ſo <hi>Arrias Montanus, Oecumen. Auguſt. Beda, Tho. Aquin. Abbas Ioachim, Rupertus, Haimo, Beza, &amp;c.</hi> But the difference in the ſenſe is nothing, the Court whether inner or outer is left vnmeaſured to figure out the power which the Gentiles ſhould haue there euen in the time of the repairing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes of Gods Church, by oppugning errour, and teaching the truth. But what is meant by the Court is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Some vnderſtand the Popiſh Clergy,<note place="margin">Pareus. Bullinger.</note> which together with the Pope haue apoſtatized from the truth, theſe are not to be meaſured but left out, as aliens from the grace of God; and fitly are they ſet forth by the inne Court, which was the Court of the Prieſts. Some vnderſtand all the Papiſts,<note place="margin">Brightman. Forbs. Graſſerus.</note> which by this figure are ſet forth to be more than the profeſſours of the truth, as the Court was greater than the Temple, and the city yet farre greater than it: ſo the Lord would hereby ſhew, that in the time of light for a long time the Pope ſhould haue the moſt followers ſtill. By treading vnder foot is meant their ſubiection to the Papacy, and the maintainers of Popery are called Gentiles, becauſe in their idolatries and ceremonies moſt like vnto them.</p>
               <p>One hath a ſingular opinion by himſelfe touching this Court and theſe Gentiles, for hee vnderſtandeth the <hi>Turkes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox.</note> and the nations ſubiect vnto them, theſe are left out, becauſe when the Church ſhould be reedified in theſe latter dayes, this reedifying ſhould not extend vnto them, but they ſhould be vnder the heathen <hi>Turkes.</hi> For mine owne part, I am much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this laſt, but ſo as that I thinke the Papiſts are not to be excluded, who keepe a great part of the Chriſtian world vnder their ſuperſtitions alſo, as the <hi>Turke</hi> doth vnder his; wherefore I reſolue that both are here meant, the <hi>Turkes</hi> are Gentiles, becauſe out of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; the Papiſts are Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, becauſe idolatrous and ſuperſtitious like the Gentiles. They together then tread vnder foot the court of Gods houſe, by holding vnder the greateſt part of the world, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath beene Chriſtian, euen ſtill in theſe dayes of light, the one in the Eaſt, the other in the Weſt.</p>

Some vnderſtand the time when the outer Court ſhould thus be troden vnder foot, by the Pope, and ſo they count from the beheading of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> reſoluing theſe moneths into dayes, 1260. and reckoning them for yeeres vnto <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, <hi>ann.</hi> 1294. out of which foure and thirty being deducted, being the age of Chriſt, not long before whom <hi>Iohn</hi> ſuffered, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine 1260. 2. One reckoning theſe moneths by dayes,<note place="margin">Brightman.</note> and taking the dayes for yeeres, not according to the <hi>Iulian</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whereby two and forty moneths make 1278. dayes, but according to the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> falling ſhort in this ſumme eighteene dayes of the <hi>Iulian,</hi> will haue the time accounted ſo much ſhort of 1260. as it exceedeth by the <hi>Iulian</hi> account, and ſo vnderſtandeth here 1242. <hi>Iulian</hi> yeeres, which time hee beginneth in the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine, ann.</hi> 304. and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it to the Councell of Trent, <hi>ann.</hi> 1546. All this time the outer Court was troden vnder foot through the hereſies that preuailed, and the two witneſſes the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propheſied in ſackcloth, but then they were killed by the authorizing of one corrupt tranſlation onely, and falſifying their Expoſitors, who had anciently giuen life vnto them by their ſound expoſitions. 3. Another vnderſtandeth the time of the <hi>Turkes</hi> tyrannizing,<note place="margin">Fox.</note> from <hi>Ottoman</hi> to the laſt that ſhall be, which he reckoneth by Sabbaths of yeeres, making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery month ſuch a Sabbath, as <hi>Daniel</hi> doth a weeke, and ſo the whole ſumme of yeeres 294. But experience ſheweth this to be but a coniecture, becauſe the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> tyranny continueth ſtill, it being now farre paſt the time thus calculated. For <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was <hi>ann.</hi> 1300. vnto which adde 294. and it will amount but to 1594. As for that of <hi>Brightman,</hi> it were to bee wiſhed that it were ſo, for according to his account, we ſhould ſoone bee deliuered both from <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> who I feare haue a longer time to continue than he imagined. But here is both a difference of eighteene yeeres, and the two and forty moneths of the Popiſh Gentiles doe not thus agree, much part of this time the Church being put to it, and the Scriptures wronged by the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of the ſecond opinion there is leſſe probability, ſeeing it is not ſet downe when this treading vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot ſhould be, but how long it ſhould endure. And as for the firſt expoſition, it were ſtrange that no certaine time ſhould be meant here, being meaſured out thus by ſo many moneths and dayes, when as both in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and other Prophets, it hath alwaies beene found that a certaine number named, hath noted out a certaine time.<note place="margin">

The time then of the Turkes tyranny muſt be 1260. yeeres, and as Turke and Pope haue the ſame beginning and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, for Hiſtory ſheweth that they beganne together, and as 42. moneths ſetting forth thus long a time, are here iointly aſcribed to the Gentiles treading the Lords holy City vnder foot, ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is agreed by all, that Antichriſt is this beaſt afterwards more amply deſcribed,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.11.</note> and many will haue the King of the Locuſts called <hi>Abaddon</hi> or <hi>Apollyon,</hi> whom alſo they take to be Antichriſt, to bee the ſame, and that he is here ſpoken of, as already well enough knowne by his preceding deſcription. I grant that this beaſt is the ſame there deſcribed, but as I ſaid vpon that place, ſo I hold ſtill, that the generall great Antichriſt, the Deuill, is meant by <hi>Apollyon</hi> and <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and not a ſucceſſion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian men, for their oppoſing of Chriſt in his truth,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:12860:198"/>called that Antichriſt. And ſo here the beaſt comming out of the bottomleſſe pit is the Deuill in his inſtruments, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be that impugne the truth, whether Mahumetans or Papals: for both fight againſt and kill the ſeruants of God for giuing teſtimony and ſtanding to his truth, and becauſe herein they follow the Deuills inſtigation and doe his worke, he is ſaid to doe it, for hee doth it in them vſing their hands and weapons thus to fight and to deſtroy. When any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Deuill is ſpoken of in particular, he is ſaid to come vp out of the Sea or out of the earth, as <hi>chap.</hi> 13. and not out of the bottomleſſe pit, as in this place.</p>
               <p>Touching the time it is ſaid, <hi>When they ſhall finiſh their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, he ſhall make warre,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is well reſolued by thoſe which hold, that howſoeuer he ſhall oppoſe them all the time of their propheſying, yet he ſhall not preuaile to kill them till they haue finiſhed the worke for which they were ſent, namely, to giue teſtimony to the truth. For it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that theſe inſtruments of the Deuill would permit quietly the witneſſes of the truth ſo long a time as was before ſet downe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1260. daies, but ſo ſoone as euer they began to propheſie, theſe beginne to fight againſt them, although the Lord, for whom they ſtand, will not ſuffer them to bee ouercome and ſlaine, till they haue fully ended that worke for which he ſent them. So that this is not to be vnderſtood, as it may ſeeme at the firſt, to be done at the end of the fore-deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed time of a 1260. daies, but within the compaſſe of this time, as each witneſſe hath finiſhed his teſtimony which hee was ſent to giue. And therefore it is to be noted, that he ſaith not when the time of their propheſying ſhall be expired, but when they ſhall finiſh their teſtimony. The whole ſucceſſion then of witneſſes is to be vnderſtood by theſe two, who are all this time, their office being done, ſome martyred after other ſome to the end of the time intimated in the 1260. daies. Some applying all this paſſage another way, vnderſtand by the finiſhing of their teſtimony the end of the whole time,<note place="margin">Brightman.

And hereby it appeareth further, that no two particular men are meant here, becauſe thus Antichriſts time muſt be ſomewhat longer than the allotted two and forty moneths, for otherwiſe hee could not kill them after his teſtimony finiſhed, which they are giuing all this time, nor inſult three daies and an halfe ouer their dead bodies.

But who ſo ſhall attentiuely conſider the whole paſſage here, ſhall eaſily finde that by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> muſt be vnderſtood neceſſarily a farre larger place than that City, ſeeing that vpon the entrance of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that which ſhall be trodden vnder foot by the Gentiles is called the holy City, which no man can deny to be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church in all parts of the world, whereof that holy City was a type, and therefore according to the vſuall phraſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture it is ſet forth by that name. This then being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, the ſame propheſie ſtill continuing about that which ſhould befall the ſeruants of God in this City, being a long time at the will of their enemies, it cannot with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be denied, but that this ſpirituall <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodome</hi> where the Lord was crucified, is the ſame holy City of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Church deſtined yet to the treading vnder foot of the Gentiles, this being one moſt tyrannous act executed by them to expoſe the murthered bodies of Gods faithfull ſeruants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried euen here. But this Church becommeth firſt another <hi>Sodom</hi> for vncleanneſſe, an <hi>Egypt</hi> for idolatries, and yet is old <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for crucifying and putting to death the Lord Ieſus in his members. This great City then is the vniuerſall Church, before called the holy City, trodden vnder foot by wicked enemies, not in reſpect of all the parts, for the Temple and the Altar are exempted, but in reſpect of thoſe parts which are oppreſſed by the enemies of the truth, both Turke &amp; Pope,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:12860:200"/>and chiefly the Pope, whoſe iuriſdiction is moſt infamous for vncleanneſſe, and therfore called <hi>Sodom,</hi> and for idolatry, being therefore called <hi>Egypt,</hi> and for murthers, being therefore here ſet forth by a Periphraſis, <hi>Where the Lord was crucified.

But theſe are ſaid to be but 7000. the generall loſſe, the fall of the tenth part of the City, becauſe this loſſe by the ſupreſſing of ſuperſtitious houſes was not ſo great, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but to particular perſons, as the vilifying of the Pope, for hereby the ſtate in generall was greatly ſhaken. For mine own part I conſent with theſe learned Authors in that wherein they all agree, that by the two Witneſſes reuiued, is not meant properly the raiſing againe of two particular perſons, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> as the Papiſts hold: for this hath beene ſufficiently confuted already, but the ſtirring vp of others in the roome of ſuch witneſſes of the truth as haue been ſlaine during the reigne of Antichriſt. Yet I doe not thinke that this is to be brought within the compaſſe of the 1260. daies, as already accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:12860:201"/>but that this ſhall be in the laſt declination of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme, at what time the enemies of the truth ſhall haue no more power to perſecute and deſtroy as yet they haue. For within the compaſſe of that time of their power as any haue beene ſtirred-vp, they haue not ſtood ſtill as affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereat, but they haue eft ſoones prepared for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (though many (thankes be God) in ſuch Nations, as wherein the liberty of the truth hath beene maintained, haue beene out of their Gunſhot.) Neither haue their preparations been in vaine, for they both haue and ſtill doe daily kill many. And therefore I cannot ſee how any time already paſt can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to that which is here figured out, here being no intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any more oppoſition &amp; deſtruction, but of fearing and fainting on the Antichriſtian part till they come to ruine. In my poore iudgement therefore, here is ſet forth what ſhall bee at the end of the halfe weeke before deſcribed by two and forty moneths, and by 1260. daies, making halfe a myſticall weeke of yeeres, and three daies and an halfe being (as all know) halfe a weeke, for ſo the Text preciſely ſaith, <hi>at the end of the three daies and an halfe.</hi> And what ſhall be then? Verily an exaltation of the truth, no where to bee trodden vnder foot any more. In the time of the Gentiles power, when ſome witneſſes are ſlaine, others are raiſed vp, but for ſo much as they are alſo impugned and many of them ſlaine, I vnderſtand the whole ſucceſſion of witneſſes by the two who were made Martyrs ſome after other ſome. But when this tragicall time ſhall be ouer, they ſhall be raiſed vp, not to be ſought againſt and to fall any more, but to terrifie the aduerſaries, to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the truth, &amp; finally to be made partakers of the kingdome of Heauen, here ſignified by their being called vp and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a cloud, a ſpeech plainly alluding to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.17.</note> 
                  <hi>We that are aliue ſhall be caught vp together in the clouds to meet the Lord in the aire, and ſo ſhall euer bee with the Lord.</hi> Now this aſcending is ſubioined immediatly after their being raiſed vp, and before the fall of the great City, not for that theſe things ſhall be done in this order (for then ſome, which ſee that fall and repent, ſhould bee conuerted at the day of iudgement, which is no time for that) but the Argument
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:12860:201"/>touching the exaltation of the faithfull is proſecuted together to the laſt, according to the vſuall manner of Scripture, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all things touching one and the ſame Argument toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though happening at diuers times, and then commeth in that of the iudgement of enemies. It is therefore to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the ſeruants of God ſhall preuaile and the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhall flouriſh, whereat feare ſhall come vpon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, neither ſhall they haue power to make reſiſtance any more, but in ſtead of being murthered as in times paſt, they ſhall to their comfort ſtand in expectation of the great Day of the Lord, when they ſhall be taken vp in the Clouds and euer remaine in bliſſe with the Lord. And thus their aſcending is alſo vnderſtood by <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Fox.</hi>

The whole drift of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine, de Ciuitate Dei,</hi> is to ſhew that here haue alwaies beene two Cities, the City of God and of the Deuill; this city of the Deuill comprehendeth the whole ſtate of the Gentiles in the preſent ſenſe, a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe whereof ſhall be when the two and forty moneths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed are ended, no profeſſed enemies to the truth bearing
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:12860:202"/>rule in any place being any more after this fatall blow to bee found: but as there is one God, ſo there ſhall be one Religion all ouer the world. There will bee perhaps ſome peruerſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries ſtill being frozen in the dregs of ſuperſtition till the glorious comming of the Lord to iudgement, which cannot then be farre off, and of this remainder it may bee that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.8.</note> that the Lord <hi>will deſtroy by the brightneſſe of his comming.</hi> And thus haue I by the grace of God gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row this long, darke, and obſcure way: let the learned conſider &amp; iudge, and if I haue erred herein, I ſhall willingly vpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of ſuch error retreat; but if nothing of moment can be obiected, let vs ſtand in a comfortable and aſſured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of this iſſue, glorious to the now deſpiſed and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termed witneſſes of the truth, but terrible to the aduerſaries that now for a time triumph ouer the dead, and ſubdued to their luſts. The day of the bitter enemies to the truth ſhall not laſt alwaies, the time of their Sunne-ſet ſhall come ſhortly, and then it ſhall gloriouſly ariſe to vs neuer to goe downe any more till the comming of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie vs with heauenly glory for euer. And in all this there is no contradiction to the Lords prediction of the ouer-ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſinne at his comming, as in the daies of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot:</hi> for when one religion is externally imbraced by all, all are not by and by reformed according to the ſame, but rather truſting to the forme of godlineſſe, moſt ſhall giue themſelues ouer to licentiouſneſſe, louing the darknes in the midſt of this light, till the Lord come vpon them as a theefe in the night to their vtter vndoing and confuſion. For by the conſent of all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Chriſtians neuer were ſo licentious as in the time of peace and freedome from perſecution of enemies, which maketh that which I haue ſaid the more probable, and ſo free from any note of contrariety to other paſſages of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

The anger of the Nations is the Popes and Papiſts indignation, ſtriuing to take reuenge for this reuolt, excommunicating Princes and abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſubiects from the oath of allegiance, and mouing the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to come with his great Armado againſt <hi>England, ann.</hi> 1588.

               <p>Againſt this expoſition, maketh firſt the fluctuating eſtate of ſome kingdomes where the truth hath beene entertained, and the holding off of moſt hitherto, whereas the Lord is ſaid after the accompliſhment of this to reigne for euer, and not ſome kingdomes, but the kingdomes of the world are ſaid to become the Lords, by which all kingdomes in generall muſt needs be vnderſtood. Againe, it is plainly forced to apply the iudging of the dead to the calling of the Iewes, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Iewes bee, as it were, dead hitherto, yet the phraſe of iudging the dead will not beare any ſuch ſenſe of comming in grace to any people, but rather with reuenge.

And indeed, for ſo much as the child in her wombe is Chriſt, as by and by ſhall be declared, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how it can ſo well agree in the ſame figure, to hold that hee is both ſet forth as the cloathing of the Church, and the fruit in her body at the ſame time, though in diuers reſpects he is &amp; euer hath been ſo.

But why twelue ſtarres in her crowne, neither more nor leſſe? Herein I take it, it is alluded to the twelue pretious ſtones in the breſt-plate of the high Prieſt, according to the number of the twelue tribes, which made this number of twelue familiar in this Prophecie, as appeareth by the twice twelue thrones round about the throne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. the twelue thouſand ſealed of the twelue Tribes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. the twelue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtones in the wals of the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the twelue gates, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:12860:205"/>many, yet they are but one myſticall body; and a male childe, as being the more perfect, and the heire, and of more courage and conſtancy. And of this expoſition applied ſpecially to the laſt times, doe the Papals moſt greedily lay hold, as making for them in their doctrine about their ſuppoſed Antichriſt. For the Churches being pained, and crying out, ſetteth forth the ſtraits wherein ſhe ſhould be at that time. And thus they ſeeke to draw the Reader from looking at any time paſt, or that now is, and to hold him in expectation of the time of Antichriſt yet for to come. But againſt this expoſition maketh both the diſtinction afterwards following in the end of this Chapter, where it is ſpoken of the reſt of her ſeed, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this childe, <hi>He ſhall rule ouer all nations with arod of iron.</hi> For if all the faithfull bee the ſeed of the woman here ſet forth, they being taken vp to heauen, how can ſhe yet haue a ſeed remaining vpon earth to be perſecuted ſtill?

Whereas it may ſeeme abſurd, that the Church is ſaid to haue Chriſt in her wombe, and to bring him forth, when as he is her husband, and ſhe hath rather her originall
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:12860:205"/>from him, for which cauſe ſhe is called his body; ſome reſolue this by applying this womans trauailing with childe and bringing forth, to the conception and birth, which is by faith. For the old Church by faith longed for, and was pained in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his comming ſo long a time, and euery man may bee ſaid to trauaile with Chriſt, and to bring him forth, when through many inward troubles, and much ſorrow for ſinne, he commeth to be regenerate, and to leade a new life, for then hee liueth not any more, but Chriſt liueth in him,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20. <hi>Bullinger.

                  </note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh; and this according to <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Gorran.</hi> But becauſe this is daily done, and here is rather an alluſion to Chriſts corporall birth, from which time, that which is here figured out beginneth to take place, it doth not ſeeme to mee to agree ſo well, and therefore I vnderſtand it rather of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall birth by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as <hi>Bullinger</hi> doth at the firſt. For although ſhee were but one particular member of the Church, yet that for the effecting of which ſhe was vſed, as an inſtrument herein, may well be aſcribed to the whole body whereof ſhe was a member, and therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the whole Iewiſh nation, ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.5.</note> 
                  <hi>(of whom Chriſt came according to the fleſh.)</hi> As for other circumſtances of being pained, and crying out to be deliuered, I hold them to be meerely allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, and not to be ſtrained to a particular ſignification; but as when a woman is neere her time of being deliuered, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by theſe ſignes, ſo they are here mentioned to ſignifie the neere approaching of the time, when the Church of the Iewes ſhould corporally in <hi>Mary</hi> (a veſſell choſen to this purpoſe) bring forth our bleſſed Sauiour. And this is one reaſon alſo, why the Church is ſet forth by a woman, becauſe the head and the chiefe vpon whom all the reſt depend, was promiſed by the name of the ſeed of the woman. If there ſhall ſeeme to bee a diſagreement in the time, becauſe the things ſet forth here were not already paſt, but altogether ſuch as ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen afterwards; I anſwer with <hi>Pareus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pareus.

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:12860:206"/>them the better, as was alſo done before in the opening of the firſt ſeale, when a white horſe iſſued out, that he might the more orderly, and with better light proceed vnto the red, and blacke, and pale horſes, &amp;c.

His taile drawing the third part of the ſtarres, and caſting them to the ground, doth yet more illuſtrate his ſtupendious power. By theſe ſtarres I vnderſtand the Angels that fell together with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who as the chiefe drew them after him, and therefore hee is ſaid to draw them with his taile, becauſe they followed him in ſinning, and were throwne downe to the ground, which was by being depriued of their place and dignity in heauen. For there is one Deuill as the chiefe and ringleader ſet forth, the reſt of the infernall ſpirits followed him. And this, though done long before, is brought in here, as auailing to a perfect deſcription of him, that it might the better appeare how formidable he was. Some by the ſtarres vnderſtand,<note place="margin">Parous.

But for ſo much as heauen is a diſtinct thing here from the Church, if the woman be the Church, for ſhee appeareth in heauen, I cannot ſee how by heauen ſhould be vnderſtood the Church here, and conſequently how by the ſtars ſhould be meant the Doctors, and therefore I reſt in the firſt expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as moſt naturall, and the rather becauſe they are not only ſaid to be ſtars, but ſtarres of heauen, as he himſelfe at the firſt was, and therefore is called <hi>Lucifer, Eſa.</hi> 14.12.</p>
               <p>Hee ſtandeth ready to deuoure this childe ſo ſoone as hee ſhould be borne, for he ſtirred vp <hi>Herod</hi> to ſend his executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to kill all the male children in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of two yeeres
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:12860:207"/>old and vnder, and from the time that he ſhewed himſelfe after his baptiſme, he neuer left perſecuting him, and plotting his deſtruction, till that at length he was crucified: but euen then in ſtead of being deuoured, nothing befell him but what hee did voluntarily vndergoe, and he was ſoone raiſed vp againe, and taken to the throne of the Father, and therefore he is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as miſſing his purpoſe herein, for ſo much as Chriſt by his death gat the dominion,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.15.

               <p>Learne we from hence both of how excellent a condition the Church of God is, heauen is her countrey, and her glory is heauenly and moſt magnificent, that we may preferre to be members of the Church before all worldly honours: and alſo what a terrible enemy we haue of the Deuill, ſo that we can no ſooner become Chriſtians, but hee is at hand to deuoure vs; neither doth he want power ſo to doe, but he ſhall not be able to hinder our ſaluation, that we may put vpon vs the armour of God; neuer being ſecure, but alwayes making account that we ſtand in the midſt of greateſt dangers, and therefore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſeeking to the higheſt power by prayer, and out of a confident expectation of being taken vp out of all danger to glory at the laſt, becomming ſtrong in the faith, to beare all oppoſitions without ſhrinking, howſoeuer we be aſſaulted.</p>

Heauen therefore is to be vnderſtood as before, when the woman is ſaid to appeare in heauen, and the great red Dragon againſt her; which was all done here below, but repreſented in heauen as the proper place of the Church, which is but a ſtranger in this world; and the place where the Deuill firſt had his abode, and where he was wont to appeare to accuſe the godly. For ſo a great fight is ſaid to bee in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when as indeed it was in this world, becauſe they which doe inſtigate and ſtirre vp vnto it, are on the one ſide the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels of God, whoſe abode is in heauen;<note place="margin">Eph. 6.12.</note> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the troupe of vncleane ſpirits, who are in heauenly places, that is, the vpper part of the aire.

But being vnderſtood, as hath beene before deliuered, all things following will excellently agree. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell with his Angels fight, that is, that principall good Angell, who is ſuperiour to all the reſt, as the Deuill is the principall of the euill Angels: he with the other good Angels, I ſay, ſtanding for the truth, ſtirred vp Chriſtian Emperours and Gouernors, to fight for the truth; and the Deuill on the other ſide with his infernall rabble, ſtirred vp Heathen Emperors and Gouernors to fight againſt the truth.<note place="margin">Forbs.

And if ſo, it is no whit abſurd to ſay that he is like God, being ſo eminent an image of his maieſty and excellency. And therefore ſome hold <hi>Michael</hi> to be an Angell indeed,<note place="margin">Fox.</note> as hath beene already ſaid, and by the ancients it hath beene generally held to be ſo, onely ſome queſtion hath beene of what Angels <hi>Michael</hi> is the chiefe, and herein moſt following <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who wrote of the orders of Angels, haue held him to bee the chiefe of the loweſt order onely.

And at this fall there is great ioy in heauen, the Angels who are miniſtring ſpirits about Gods choſen being greatly affected with their proſperity: for if when one ſinner is conuerted there bee ioy in heauen,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.</note> then much more when ſo many thouſands are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from ſo great a ſinne as idolatry is.

And well may we by the inhabiters of the earth and ſea, vnderſtand the wicked Roman Empire, euen after the ſuppreſſion of idolatry, both becauſe they were Lords of land and ſea, and becauſe though there were now a forme of religion, yet all was full of cruelty, hatred and deſpight, by reaſon of the hereſies which gat head in thoſe times, as hath beene ſhewed before in ſpeaking of the blacke horſe. Some yet hold,<note place="margin">Fox.

As for the ſhort time which the Deuill is ſaid to haue, I aſſent to thoſe, that approue the whole time from hence to the end of the world to be but ſhort, according to the Scripture phraſe, and by comparing it with the eternity to come afterwards.

And to make the time of this flight to bee three hundred yeeres the more probably, they obſerue, that not a Doues, but Eagles wings are giuen vnto her, arguing a flight ſtrong and of long continuance.<note place="margin">Forbs.</note> Some referring it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, will haue him to bee the great Eagle, giuing wings to the woman to flie into the wilderneſſe, by enduing the Church with ſo much worldly wealth, whereupon much corruption ſoone crept in, and ſhe became like a woman in the wilderneſſe; but extend the time here ſet forth no further, but till the riſing of the beaſts in the next Chapter, vnto which a way is hereby made.</p>
               <p>Some referring this time to the Apoſtles dayes,<note place="margin">Fox.</note> hold two times of perſecution, the one of the Primitiue Church, ſet forth <hi>ver.</hi> 6. the other of the Church vnder Antichriſt towards the end of the world, ſet forth here. Either time is the ſame, one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, that which time, and times, and halfe a time is, and the ſame with the two and forty moneths before deſcribed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. which if they bee reckoned as <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes, ſeuen yeeres to a moneth, they make two hundred ninety and foure yeeres. And ſuch a time was the Church vnder perſecution vntill <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> from whence one thouſand yeeres being counted of Satans bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. together they amount to one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred yeeres, at what time this perſecution by Papiſts and Turkes began, the vttermoſt end thereof being 1594. But experience hath already confuted this, it being now 1625. and yet theſe perſecutions holding out. There are other computations made here by others alſo, as of three yeeres and a halfe, which hath beene ſufficiently refuted alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<note place="margin">Graſſerus.</note> and of ſo much time as maketh this to fall vpon the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:12860:210"/>of the ſixteenth century, when Popery began to decline. But I will not trouble the Reader with more varieties. If I may put in my coniecture amongſt others, I take it, this time is not to begin in the Apoſtles dayes, becauſe it is the ſame with the 42. moneths of <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> being trodden vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,<note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> and the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the two witneſſes prophecying in ſackcloth, which beginneth not till the ſixt trumpet, as hath beene already ſhewed; and it ſeemeth to be too general, by a time thus many wayes ſo often deſcribed, to vnderſtand onely a time without any certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, ſeeing experience of former Prophecies teacheth, that when time is thus ſet forth by a certaine number of daies, or weeks, or months, a certaine proportion of time to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by counted is meant. Neither would I begin it in the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, becauſe the Church was not then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, but maintained, though there were ſome ſtirres by meanes of <hi>Arrius,</hi> whereas a perſecution here is intimated, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Church ſo hard to it, as that ſhe is faine to flie into the Wilderneſſe for ſafety. And it is ſtrange, that if this time were meant and thence forward till <hi>Phocas,</hi> which was 300. yeeres, wherein they ſay ſhe was fleeing, that any mention ſhould be made of wings to flie with, which in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon reaſon argue ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I thinke therefore that this time is to be referred to the yeeres following the deſtruction made by the <hi>Goths</hi> &amp; <hi>Vandals</hi> when they were expelled out of <hi>Italy,</hi> which was betweene the yeere 500. and 600. for not long after this the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Weſt hauing climbed vp into the chaire of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, great troubles beganne about images by their meanes, they being bitter againſt thoſe that would haue no Images in diuine worſhip, daring to anathematize euen Emperours that withſtood them, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the Eaſt perſecuted all that would not receiue his damnable Alcoran, as hath beene already ſhewed to haue beene done about <hi>ann.</hi> 606.</p>
               <p>Here was now a new kind of perſecution begun, not by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolaters, to bring in the worſhip of Deuils againe, but of ſuch as were Chriſtians in ſhew, but indeed pleading for <hi>Baal</hi> vnder a new name, and of ſuch as reuiued Iudaiſme againe in part in ſomewhat a different manner, vnder pretence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> or Prophet of God, <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Then the Church hath two wings of an Eagle giuen her to flie into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as ſometime the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid to haue beene brought out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> vpon Eagles wings,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.4.</note> and they are two, becauſe by faith &amp; patience they are borne out of this danger, as is ſaid in the Chapter following.<note place="margin">Chap. 13.10.</note> By this flying into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe then is meant, that after ſuch time as the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Turke</hi> thus inuaded the Church of God, ſhe held no viſible ſtate any more by ruling in all Countries and Nations, by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing Cities and Townes, but as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being carried out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into the Wilderneſſe, wandred a long time vp and downe in vnknowne places, being fed with Manna from Heauen, and ſo preſerued yet from periſhing: ſo the Church of God all this time lieth hid, ſuch as hold the truth ſtill being of ignoble condition in worldly reſpects, and ſo not taken ſuch notice of in the moſt and greateſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, but yet ſhe is prouided of ſuch ſpirituall food, though in ſecret places, as that ſhe is miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued from periſhing. And the time of this her ſolitarineſſe is before ſaid to be 1260. daies, as in <hi>chap.</hi> 11. here <hi>time, and times, and halfe a time,</hi> time being put for a myſticall yeere, times for two yeeres, halfe a time for halfe a yeere, which together are three yeeres and an halfe, wherein are 1260. daies, which ſet forth here ſo many yeeres, as was proued <hi>chap.</hi> 11. If it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why this variety is vſed in expreſſing the ſame time, <hi>Pareus</hi> reſolueth it well,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pareus.</hi> This phraſe is borrowed from <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.25. and c. 12.7. where it ſetteth forth the time of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> his rage who was the forerunner of Antichriſt. <hi>Brightman.</hi>
                  </note> that this is done that we might not faint vnder this perſecution when we ſhall ſee it laſt long: for though being ſet forth by 1260. daies it may ſeeme ſhort, yet the Spirit of God would haue vs know that it is a long time as we account, there being firſt a certaine ſpace of time, and when that is expired, times, and laſt of all, halfe a time more; and <hi>Brightmans</hi> conceit herein is excellent, that haply the Lord by this diſtinction would haue vs vnderſtand, that in this time of Antichriſts reigne, and the Churches being vnder, there are three diſtinctions; one of Antichriſts riſe, wherein was the beginning of this womans ſolitude to bee vnderſtood by a time, for in this ſpace he came to his height, and the Church was brought to the loweſt ebbe; the ſecond, of his
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:12860:211"/>holding in that ſtate which is twice as long; the third, of his declining when the Church ſhall grow towards her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is effected in halfe a time. Thus he. But I hold me rather to the former reſolution, as more agreeable to that which I haue before deliuered touching the determination of this time, which in all probability will not be till <hi>ann.</hi> 1860. And then the declining time of Antichriſt and the riſing time of the Church will bee 360. yeeres.</p>
               <p>And thus I haue deliuered what I conceiue touching the time when this perſecution beginneth: for when we come to expound the time of continuance in the Wilderneſſe, I hold the ſame with diuers learned Writers on our ſide before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, who make the Cities conculcation, when the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes propheſie, and the time of this lying hid in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all one.

               <p>Touching the floud caſt out of the Dragons mouth after the woman,<note place="margin">Brightman.</note> which was by the earth ſwallowed vp in ſuccour of the woman, ſome vnderſtand it of the ouerflowing of <hi>Africa</hi> and part of <hi>Europe,</hi> by the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Heruls,</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobards,</hi> by whom the whole Church was endangered as by a floud of being vtterly extinct, but theſe earthly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people ſet forth by the earth, comming into theſe parts were brought to the embracing of the Chriſtian Religion, though corruptly, and ſo became more milde towards Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, which is the earths ſwallowing vp of the floud.

The earth, hee ſaith, ſome interpret to be Chriſt for his ſtability, ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels called from all parts of the earth for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of hereſies, which is not likely, ſeeing ſuch Councels do rather reſemble Heauen,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> &amp; Chriſt is ſaid to be from Heauen heauenly, in oppoſition to ſuch as be from the earth earthly.

But for ſo much as I haue already gone from the ground of this expoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> the reckoning of the time of the womans fleeing to be 300. yeeres, and this floud was caſt out after her vpon her fleeing, and being come into the wilderneſſe, which was in a ſhort time, for ſhe was ſoone chaſed thither, and when ſhe abode there, this floud was ſent out after her: I muſt needs
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:12860:212"/>rather ſubſcribe to them, which hold that the time of caſting out this floud was in the time here deſcribed,<note place="margin">Graſſerus.</note> ſaid to bee <hi>a time, and times, and halfe a time,</hi> and ſo ſome great warres at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by the Popes inſtigation for the vtter rooting out of the reformed Religion are figured out by the floud. And of ſuch warres we ſhall finde there haue beene many euer ſince the breaking out of the light in the time of <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and before that againſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes,</hi> and afterwards againſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where diuers great men entred a league to root them out. But the earth holpe the woman. The Hiſtory of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> warres is moſt famous for the illuſtrating of this: for <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour, being ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the Pope to perſecute the <hi>Bohemians</hi> for cleauing conſtantly to the Doctrine of <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> after that it and they were condemned in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> inuaded <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> with a great power, but his army being ouerthrowne and much waſted by a few ſcattered troupes of the <hi>Huſſites,</hi>

                  </note> the Emperour departed home much diſcouraged. But ſoone after greater forces are ſent againſt them being led by the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Marqueſſe of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Treuers,</hi> by the inſtigation of Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth. They entered in three great armies, but when the <hi>Huſſites</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Ziſca</hi> appeared, a feare came vpon them all and they fled with all haſte, caſting away their weapons, and leauing their Tents well furniſhed to the enemy.

What was this but a moſt miraculous preſeruing of the Church by Gods owne immediate hand, there being nothing but the very earth that affrighted them ſo ſoone as they came into that land, being taken with an horrible feare againſt all ſenſe and reaſon. And thus at ſundry other times, the Church being aſſaulted in other parts ſhe was miraculouſly preſerued, not by any power of her owne, but by the hand of God, being againſt her enemies and for her, which deliuerance is ſaid to come by
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:12860:213"/>the earth, helping her in alluſion to the Hiſtory of the lands, ſpuing out of the Cananites before the Iſraelites, or of the earths opening the mouth to ſwallow vp <hi>Corah</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> being indangered by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy might be preſerued.<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> For this ſeemeth to me the moſt probable reſolution of this ſaying, which was alſo noted out of <hi>Pareus</hi> before. To this if we ioyne that of the differences hapning betweene Catholike Princes about earthly things,<note place="margin">Graſſerus.</note> keeping them from vniting to extirpe the Church at other times, it may alſo further ſerue to cleare this place the more, and in the Eaſt the differences of the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Turke</hi> being both for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> yet diuided about <hi>Haly</hi> his ſucceſſour, whereby the <hi>Turkes</hi> haue ſtill beene hindered from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed inuaſions of Chriſtendome. The Church haue had alſo other helpe from the Princes of the earth, who hath beene ſtirred vp to fauour and defend the truth, as the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, who ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Hollander</hi> being at the point of drowning, abated the pride of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and maintained the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>France.</hi> That all this paſſage is allegoricall, and will beare ſuch expoſition, is plaine, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>as it were a riuer,</hi> and ſo it is but as if the earth had holpe the woman againſt this riuer by deuouring it, ſeeing there is nothing more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, than by a floud to ſet forth great armies flowing into Countries to deſtroy them.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Irenaeus. Ambroſe. Proſper. Methodius. Arethas. Andreas. Bellarmin. Gagneus. Ribera.</note> There is a third opinion of ſuch as hold Antichriſt to be figured out here both by the firſt and ſecond beaſt, affirming that they are both one and the ſame, but in diuers reſpects ſaid
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:12860:215"/>to be one and another, for which they bring diuers reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the deſcription of this beaſt &amp; of the little horne in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which by the conſent of all is a figure of Antichriſt doth notably agree. Secondly, becauſe the beaſt out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. which is Antichriſt, and this out of the ſea is all one. Thirdly, becauſe that beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. which is Antichriſt, and this is all one. Laſtly, whatſoeuer is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Antichriſt for blaſpheming, for vniuerſall reigning, and for being followed and adored, is attributed to this beaſt. Hitherto therefore euen the moſt learned amongſt the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts agree: but when it is more particularly determined who this Antichriſt is, they part: for they expect one to come, and ours hold that he is the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the whole ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of that Sea euer ſince <hi>Phocas</hi> granted vnto him to bee vniuerſall Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Theſe two opinions, howſoeuer they may ſeeme either of them ſo probable, as that it is hard to except againſt them, yet if ſome circumſtances be conſidered, they doe neither fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, but there is need yet to finde out ſome other expoſition of theſe viſions. For firſt, that of the Heathen Emperours cannot be ſo well approued, becauſe the Deuils fight by his inſtruments againſt the Church in her deſolate eſtate is here ſet forth, as is moſt plaine from the laſt words of the twelfth Chapter, which as it hath beene proued, muſt needs be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the times of Popery and not of Heatheniſme, and the time of two and forty moneths, and the circumſtance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre with the Saints doe ſo agree with the beaſts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre with the two Witneſſes, and the holy Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trodden vnder foot two and forty moneths, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. as that it is doubtleſſe the ſame vnder another figure and in other words. Againe, for that of the Roman Antichriſt, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be here ſet forth, yet I cannot ſee how two beaſts ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of diuers places at ſeuerall times and ſhapes ſhould be one &amp; the ſame. It is true indeed, after mention here once made of two, both in the end of this Chapter and afterwards <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. we reade but of one, yet this proueth not that they are both one, for the word is varied, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. and that which is here another beaſt with two hornes, is there a woman ſitting
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:12860:215"/>vpon the beaſt, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.20. the falſe prophet, and ſo likewiſe <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.10. <hi>For the beaſt and the falſe prophet are caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> It ſeemeth therefore to mee that by the firſt beaſt is to be vnderſtood the Imperiall Roman ſtate, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed thorowout ſo many Countries and Nations, all ouer which Antichriſt reigneth: and by the ſecond, which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaid alſo to be a woman and a falſe prophet, the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Rome,</hi> which as Antichriſt ſwaieth all againſt the truth of Chriſt, cauſing men rather to reuerence and to ſtand in awe of his greatneſſe, which conſiſteth in the beaſt whereupon he rideth, and which hee weildeth and ordereth at his pleaſure. And to this <hi>Pareus</hi> in effect plainly commeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pareus.</hi> Chap. 17.8.</note> when as hauing found ſome incongruities in the expoſitions of all others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beaſt, of which it is ſaid, <hi>It was, and is not, and yet ſhall aſcend,</hi> he determineth that Antichriſt was in the Heathen Monarchy of the Romans, becauſe that Monarchy afterwards became Antichriſts, and yet hee is ſaid <hi>not to be,</hi> that is, in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time, becauſe he had not yet that power. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, all circumſtances will well agree, neither can any exception be iuſtly taken againſt it. The beaſt comming out of the Sea ſetteth forth the Roman Empire generally to be conſidered from the firſt ariſing thereof euen vnto the end, with a ſpeciall reference to that which ſhould be done therein in the two and forty moneths, or 1260. daies, or a time, times, and halfe a time of Antichriſts iuriſdiction, when the Church ſhould be moſt indangered, for the better knowledge of which Antichriſt, this ſtate wherein he ſhould gouerne is ſo fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. So that if any man ſhall obiect that the order of theſe viſions, this being after the perſecuting of the woman who fled into the Wilderneſſe, will not beare ſuch an expoſition as whereby it ſhould be vnderſtood of the Roman Empire from the beginning, which was long before, it is eaſily anſwered; that for ſo much as the thing intended is not to ſhew when this Empire began, or what was anciently done therein, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo farre forth as might auaile to giue light into thoſe paſſages that properly concerned after times, which could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out propounding a generall view of that eſtate from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning be ſo well conceiued of, order may well admit ſuch a
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:12860:216"/>figure to be brought vpon the ſtage, as whereby things long before paſt are repreſented, being auaileable to helpe to the vnderſtanding of the figures of things afterwards to come. For the ſimilitude of a beaſt it is vſuall, and it was before in <hi>Daniel,</hi> by a beaſt to repreſent a Monarchy, which is againſt the truth, becauſe ſuch haue no more vnderſtanding than a beaſt, and as a monſtrous beaſt deuoureth and deſtroieth moſt cruelly. It is ſaid to riſe out of the Sea becauſe it is conſtituted of many peoples, as was ſaid before, for waters are afterwards expounded to be peoples. The ſeuen heads are the ſeuen ſorts of gouernment in that Monarchy, for thus it will agree beſt, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. the ten hornes crowned are the Prouinces wherein Conſuls with a regall power ruled.

Thirdly, of ſome that hold <hi>Heraclius</hi> in the Eaſt to haue beene this head, in whoſe daies by the <hi>Turkes</hi> in the Eaſt, and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in the Weſt, the Imperiall State became deſperate: but it was cured by <hi>Charles</hi> the great. And at lenghth he deliuereth his owne opinion, that the Pope is this head, who was deadly wounded when the diuiſion hapned betwixt the <hi>Italians</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> chooſing for Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the ſixth, the <hi>French Clement</hi> the ſeuenth, about <hi>ann.</hi> 1390. after whom two Popes, and laſtly, three conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the Councell of <hi>Conſtance, ann.</hi> 1417. when by the

               <p>Touching his owne opinion, I cannot ſee how it can ſtand, becauſe that after this all the world is ſaid to follow after the beaſt, and warre is made with the Saints who are ouercome, and power is giuen to the beaſt to doe two and forty moneths, whereas after the Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> many that had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Pope within a few yeeres fell from him, and warres were made againſt him with ſucceſſe in diuers places, neither is his time halfe ſo long, if we reckon the 42. moneths, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</p>

                  <hi>Alphonſus Mantuanus</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> referreth this wound to the time of the breaking forth of the light of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Alphonſus Mantuanus.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diuers Countries in a ſhort time fell from the Pope, by which as by a deadly wound he ſeemed, as it were, to lye a dying, but reuiued againe by proſpering in his warres vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken againſt the Reformers: but neither doth the time agree to this.</p>
               <p>There is another opinion,<note place="margin">Fox.</note> that this mortall wound was giuen by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory, and how deadly they wounded the Roman State, ſee vpon <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. vnder the fift Trumpet. This wound beganne <hi>ann.</hi> 469. and laſted till that <hi>Totilas</hi> being ouercome by <hi>Narſes,</hi> a Captaine ſent by <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> Emperour in the Eaſt, about <hi>ann.</hi> 560. there was an end put to the Kingdome of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and this they count the healing of this wound; one part of the ſtate being brought to miſery by theſe barbarous people, but the other remaining whole ſtill vnder the Emperours of the Eaſt, and ſuccouring it thus in proceſſe of time. And when the <hi>Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> had againe brought a great part in ſubiection to them reigning 204. yeeres, they were expelled by <hi>Charles the great,</hi> being ſtirred vp hereunto by the Pope, and thus this wound was perfectly cured.</p>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:12860:217"/>
               <p>Others agreeing in the wound,<note place="margin">Forbs.</note> hold that the cure was made by the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> working by flattery, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſanctity ſo effectually euen with the Conquerours, that they brought their necks vnder their yoke, and ſo reigned ouer all in the priſtin ſplendor of the old Roman Empire. And ſome conſent that <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> beganne the cure,<note place="margin">Brightman.</note> not onely by repreſſing thoſe Barbarians, but alſo by decreeing that the Biſhop of old <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be the chiefe Prieſt of all,<note place="margin">Conſtitut.

               <p>Touching theſe three laſt, and the third before mentioned by <hi>Pareus,</hi> there is not much difference in them: for they all agree about the time when this wound was giuen, namely when the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> with other Barbarians preuailed ſo far, as that the Roman Empire was quite ouerthrowne &amp; lay diuers yeeres for dead. And this is vndoubtedly the wound here meant, which cannot be applied to any particular perſon to be vnderſtood by this head, becauſe it reuiueth gaine, ſo as neuer did any particular Emperour; but to the Imperiall ſtate which had life again afterwards, &amp; was more adored and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than euer, as is here afterwards declared. The difference then is about the time of this cure and the perſon by whom it was wrought. And herein I prefer that expoſition which maketh the Pope the Chirurgeon, by flatteries &amp; colourable perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, aduancing his Sea at <hi>Rome</hi> to as vniuerſall a ſouereignty as was ſometime that of the imperial ſeat in the ſame City, which was effected in the daies of <hi>Phocas. ann.</hi> 606. and more eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed not long after by <hi>Pipin</hi> the French King, and vindicated from the moleſtation of the <hi>Longobards</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the great his ſonne, and in proceſſe of time by the Popes practiſes aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, ſo as that this ſea reigned as well in the Eaſt as in the Weſt, euen as the old Roman Emperours were wont to doe. And thus, as this deadly wound was long in making, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great diuided the Eaſt from the Weſt, (which was a great weakening to this State, <hi>Rome</hi> reigning now but in theſe Weſterne parts, which was wont to reigne ouer all) and growing more deepe and deadly by the comming in of the Barbarians: ſo it was long in curing, the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:12860:218"/>cure being begunne in the time of <hi>Phocas,</hi> and increaſed by a Councell at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Baſilius</hi> who ſlew his aſſociate <hi>Michael,</hi>

Now that this is a blaſpheming of God, it hath beene a tenent ſo ordinary and common, as that when our Sauiour Chriſt did take the like vpon himſelfe, as to be the Sonne of God, and ſo God; the Iewes cryed out, hee hath blaſphemed: neither can a man ſpeake greater things of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and more blaſphemous againſt God than theſe. He blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeth his Tabernacle, which is his Church; by vaunting that the Church whereof he is the head is the onely true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, arrogating thus vnto his Apoſtaticall Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue that which is proper to the true Church of God, and as for the true Church indeed, he ladeth it with moſt ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Whilſt I was conſidering of theſe diuers expoſitions, I heard a man of great note for his accurate calculating of theſe times, handling this very point; his opinion was, that this time ought to be begun when the head ſpoken of in the Text was deadly wounded by the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the <hi>Gothes, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Rugians,</hi> which becauſe it was not all at once, but at three moſt remarkable times, firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of <hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes, ann.</hi> 414.2.

               <p>But this beginning of the time cannot ſtand, becauſe to haue power to doe, argueth life and ſtrength, and not a languiſhing eſtate, as of one deadly wounded; and in the order of the Text, it is after the healing of the wound againe, that this power is
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:12860:221"/>giuen to the beaſt, and not in the time that he lay bleeding vnder the wound. Againſt that of <hi>Brightman</hi> I haue ſhewed my reaſon before, <hi>Cha.</hi> 11.2. and it is improbable that this time of two and forty moneths ſhould be interrupted, and ſo to be made vp by one hundred &amp; forty yeeres following after: and if it be taken together, &amp; ſo ended at the time of the Councell of Trent, the Pope hath farre exceeded his limited time, ſeeing he hath made ſo much ſtirre about religion, now foureſcore yeeres ſince, and ſtill preuaileth mightily, and ſo here were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſolid comfort in the prophecy. The errour in <hi>Du Moulin</hi> is in that he beginneth this time too high, long after the wound healed, whereas the time of any Potentate is to bee reckoned, not from his comming to an height and perfection of power, but from his very firſt beginning to reigne, though more weakly. The reſt that apply theſe moneths to the old Roman Empire, conſider not the wound made and healed, after which the computation ought to begin, and whereas the ſcope of this Reuelation is chiefly to comfort vs againſt the Roman An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt by ſetting a bound to his reigne, by this their expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion applying this time another way they leaue it boundleſſe. Other expoſitions there are, but leſt I ſhould be ouer tedious, I omit to recite them, reſoluing moſt confidently, that this time began <hi>ann.</hi> 606. as I ſhewed before vpon <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.2. when the deadly wound of the Roman Empire might well bee ſaid to be healed in the Popes riſe and firſt attaining to ſuch v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall authority.</p>
               <p>Touching that Epiphonema <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12.<note place="margin">Verſ. 10, 11.</note> it is agreed that it is added to ſtirre vp men to a diligent enquity about Antichriſt, that finding him out, they may take heed of being carried on with others to worſhip him to the deſtruction of their ſoules: the comfort is, that Antichriſt who hath tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized for a time, by killing with the ſword, and bringing his oppugners to great miſery, ſhall finally periſh moſt miſerably himſelfe, at what time the Saints who haue ſuffered vnder him ſhall haue perfect deliuerance.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This beaſt is the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who doth no more differ from the firſt beaſt, but that the ſtate whereof hee is the head is repreſented by it, and hee the head ruling in that ſtate by this. They which by the firſt beaſt vnderſtand the old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours, by this doe generally vnderſtand the Popes reuiuing that decaying Empire: but they which make both theſe beaſts one and the ſame,<note place="margin">Pareus.

Why the firſt beaſt may not be taken for the Roman Emperours of old, I haue already ſhewed, and touching this guard, or theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments helping to aduance the beaſt, I cannot ſee how they ſhould bee here repreſented:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brightman.</hi> He hath equall power with the beaſt, ſo as no inſtrument of the Popes hath or euer had.</note> for it is not any body but an head which the Spirit of God doth altogether apply himſelfe to deſcribe here; this beaſt therefore doth ſet forth the Popes when they came to an Imperiall dignity, thus putting life againe into that ſtate altogether ruined by the irruptions and preuailings of the Barbarians.</p>
               <p>That which is here repreſented doth ſerue to declare, how &amp; by what meanes the deadly wounded head was healed, &amp; after that preuailed ſo wonderfully: for ſomething hauing beene ſhortly ſpoken of the Roman State, as it was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, that Antichriſt, whoſe deſcription is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, might be the better vnderſtood; it is ſhewed firſt, that after this head wounded, he ſprang vp by the healing of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then more at large this Antichriſt the Authour of ſo great a cure is deſcribed, and what power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes he vſed to effect it.</p>

He hath two hornes like the Lambe,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:12860:222"/>becauſe the Lambe the Lord Ieſus is his pretence, he boaſteth himſelfe to bee his Vicar: but hee hath onely two of his ſeuen hornes, to intimate his weakneſſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the fulneſſe of Chriſts power. <hi>Hee ſpeaketh like the Dragon,</hi> that is, like the Deuill, for the Dragon hath been before ſhewed to be the Deuill; concerning whom, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we reade nothing before of his ſpeaking, yet that he had a mouth to ſpeake is intimated, in that the firſt beaſt being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued, to whom he gaue his throne and power, is ſaid alſo to haue giuen vnto him a mouth to ſpeake great things and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. His ſpeech then is added, that he might bee the better diſcouered, as the Aſſe of <hi>Cuma</hi> marching in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons skin was diſcouered by his braying. If a man ſhould looke at nothing but his hornes like the Lambes, that is, his goodly pretence of ſetting forth Chriſt and the right gouerning of his Church, he might eaſily be deceiued, but attend his ſpeech ſo full of pride, arrogancy and blaſphemy, whereof it hath beene ſpoken before,<note place="margin">Brightman.</note> and thou mayeſt eaſily diſcerne him to bee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. Some expound his riſing out of the earth, of his riſe by the helpe of ſecular powers aboue them all, and his two hornes of <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Pipin</hi> ſubduing the <hi>Longobards,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemies vnto him, applying this his riſe vnto thoſe times wherein he did ſo much differ from that which hee was before, that he is, as it were, another beaſt for the acceſſion of more authority. He ſpeaketh like the Dragon alſo, ſay they, in that as the old Emperours,<note place="margin">Nappier.</note> ſo hee depoſeth and ſetteth vp for Kings whom he willeth.

But the expoſitions of ours already ſet downe make

And it is indeed abſurd to imagine the fulfilling of theſe things according to the letter, for ſo Antichriſtianiſme ſhould be no myſtery, neither ſhould there need ſuch wiſdome by the number of his name to finde out Antichriſt.

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:12860:225"/>them, that he alone may goe away with all the honour: but it is a religious kinde of worſhip which is here meant, and the Pope himſelfe is this Image, and he doth ſay vnto men, That they ſhould make this Image by teaching it to bee neceſſary vnto ſaluation to haue the ſucceſſor of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> for vniuerſall Emperour of the world: for this is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to reare vp an Image of the firſt beaſt, that is, of the old Imperiall authority: and becauſe that if the Pope had no more but this title without any liuely Imperiall power, hee ſhould be but as it were a dead Image and expoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, he bringeth it about by his bewitching doctrine, that he is thus eſteemed in the hearts of men who are all ready to fight for his honour as for the diuine Maieſty, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all oppugners, and thus he putteth life into this Image, &amp;c. For this beaſt is both a beaſt and a falſe prophet; as he is ſet forth by the name of a beaſt, his authority is intimated, that he is a great ruler and commander; as he is a falſe prophet, hee raiſeth vp his Empire and command by his deluſions to ſuch an height, as that he becommeth a very liuely Image of the ſupreme Roman Maieſty, not ſuffering himſelfe to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted any more than the old Emperours did. The wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of theſe times doth ſhew the truth of this propheſie, there being nothing whereof the Pope is ſo tender as of this Vniuerſall honour, not ſparing ſex or age, but killing all that will not giue it vnto him.</p>
               <p>Touching the marke which all are cauſed to receiue on their forehead or right hand,<note place="margin">Verſ. 16. <hi>Pareus.</hi>
                  </note> though <hi>Bullinger</hi> and ſome others hold, the marke, the name, &amp; the number of the name to be all one, yet ſome diſtinguiſh them, expounding the marke of the indelible Character, which Prieſts and religious perſons are ſaid to receiue in their ordination, when lifting vp their right hand they ſweare fidelity to the Pope, and by anointings and raſures they are marked in the forehead for his: and the name and number of his name, of the marke, which all others of that Religion receiue, which is to be called Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.

And if the marke were a diuers thing from the name or number of the name, it would haue beene as needfull to ſet men a worke to finde out all three, as this one of the number of the name. I ſubſcribe therefore to <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Napier</hi> touching the identity of theſe three. Touching the name, and number of the name, wee ſhall ſee more in the next queſtion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Richard. de Sancto victore.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:12860:226"/>him that hath wiſdome finde out the number,<note place="margin">Ribera.</note> for to number is the point of a man, not of any other creature which is void of vnderſtanding: according to others, the number of a man,<note place="margin">Arethas.</note> becauſe a familiar and ordinary name amongſt men: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to others, the number of a man,<note place="margin">Beda.</note> not of any deuill or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature, for no ſuch is to be vnderſtood, though he hath beene hitherto ſpoken of as a beaſt; and to this laſt doe I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, as plainly thwarting that fond popiſh conceit, that Antichriſt ſhould be begotten by the Deuill; for as touching his generation, he ſhall be but an ordinary man as others are. An ordinary name it is vnlikely that it ſhould be, becauſe by it Antichriſt is to be knowne from others, ſo as he could not be by his name, if it were common to other men alſo: neither needed there any ſuch caution to ſay, that the number is of a man, as hee doth vſually vnderſtand numbers, which other creatures doe not, for this is a thing commonly knowne without admonition, and it is implyed in the words before that he muſt be a man and a wiſe man that can caſt vp this count.</p>

I cannot be perſwaded that the Spirit would haue vs looke barely to this number, but to the very letters here vſed.

Ambsbert.</note> It hath bin an ancient opinion, that the compend which is vſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the name Chriſt ſhould bee the marke of Antichriſt, which compend is this, ☧ the lower part of which is τ, the vpper part ρ, the Croſſe intermingled with the τχ, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther χρτ, Chriſt. And herein <hi>Ambsbertus</hi> is ſo confident, that he ſaith it was reuealed vnto him. Somewhat anſwerable vnto this is that which ſome haue deliuered touching the marke of the beaſt, which they ſay is the ſigne of the Croſſe, for that is made in diuers figures, two of which our Lords Croſſe ✝ and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrewes</hi> Croſſe ☓ as they call them, are plainly in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. Now the name is ſomewhat more than the marke, for when a man ſetteth his marke vpon any thing he doth it by a letter or two, ſo the marke here is but one letter χ or τ, but the name hath in it three letters of note, χξς, not much different from the forenamed compend of Chriſt, for in ſtead of ς being as much as <hi>ſt,</hi> there is τ the laſt letter of this name, and in ſtead of χ.ρ which as one hath well noted, if it be written thus, <hi>x,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Napier.</note> as it often is, it doth not differ from the letter, which in Latine is equiualent to ξ in Greeke, for ſometime <hi>x</hi> is written thus, and if otherwiſe, as is more vſuall, it is thus, χ, and ſo is moſt ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the marke before ſpoken of. And it is to be thought that the Spirit of God purpoſely altered the middle letter, putting χ in ſtead of ρ, that we might take occaſion to ſeeke in another language the myſtery that lieth more cloſe vnder the Greeke ξ, but is moſt apparant in the Latine X, and ſo in the Latine ſtate find the beaſt here pointed at, which in all things preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chriſt, but in truth is altogether for ſuperſtitious croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:12860:228"/>and other vaine humane inuentions, the true <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or root of truth, Chriſt, ſignified in ρ being put out, or quite hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den through the multitude of ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, I hold, that the number of the beaſts name conſiſting in three letters, is the number of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Name of Chriſt, with the alteration of the middle let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into one equiualent to the Roman X. being a Croſſe, which is vſually by the Popes and Roman Catholikes affixed at the end of this or any other name of Chriſt, as thus <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but hath not beene thus vſed by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts or Apoſtles: ſo that where we find a chiefe ruler aboue all others glorying in the bare name of Chriſt, and in the figure of the Croſſe, we may confidently affirme there is Antichriſt, for euen very ancient Writers haue held, that he ſhould come vnder the faireſt pretence of holineſſe. And where can wee elſe finde ſuch an one in all the world, but in the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Biſhop whereof calleth himſelfe Chriſts Vicar, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth himſelfe as if he were Chriſt, forgiuing ſinnes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bee the husband of the Church, and the rocke where-vpon ſhee is built, the very peculiars of Chriſt Ieſus; and as for the figure of the Croſſe, it is alwayes carried before him, all his Buls of pardon are guarded with many Croſſes, and he maketh Croſſes to bleſſe himſelfe and the people. By a ſingular diuine art therefore is hee ſet forth by theſe letters, which are all the letters numerall both in the Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Alphabet, repreſenting the Croſſe, for χ is a plaine Croſſe, and τ the laſt letter of ς, and if you take it together it doth alſo ſignifie the Croſſe, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and therefore may well be marked out by ς the firſt letters thereof, and ξ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the letter equiualent thereto amongſt thoſe to whom it properly pertaineth is χ the figure of a Croſſe, or take it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with χ, and it may well ſet forth the Croſſe, which is <hi>Crux,</hi> or more barbarouſly written, as it is ſometime, <hi>Chrux,</hi> ſeeing theſe two χ ξ are the firſt and laſt letters of the word, which in ſhort writing are vſed for the whole word.</p>

Why will ye beleeue other reuelations of other your writers if not this, being conteſted vnto by grounds of truth? If it ſhall be ſaid, then wee in the Church of <hi>England</hi> haue the badge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, becauſe we haue croſſes in Baptiſme, vpon our coine, and in ſundry places; I anſwer, it is not the bare vſing of a Croſſe that maketh this badge, but the aſcribing of vertue thereto to bleſſe euery thing, as we doe not, and glorying in the externall forme, which is farre from vs.</p>
               <p>It is the point of euery wiſe man to enquire into theſe things, for he that hath wiſdom is bidden to count the number;<note place="margin">Note.</note> and if we be not of the number of the wiſe, but fooliſh, God will not acknowledge vs for his, no more than the fooliſh Virgins.

And indeed, if Virgins properly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſhould be meant, many abſurdities would follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. 1.

               <p>Touching their following of Chriſt whitherſoeuer he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is well expreſſed further by ſome,<note place="margin">Bullinger.

               <p>Others taking theſe Angels for three of the ſeuen, which are afterwards ſhewed to powre out their vials,<note place="margin">Napier.</note> vnderſtand by the firſt, the forenamed prime Preachers, <hi>Luther, Zwinglius, &amp;c.</hi> by the ſecond, a great ruining of the Popiſh Empire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>ann.</hi> 1590. and by the third, the vtter fall of the Pope, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>ann.</hi> 1639. after which time, ſome will ſtill remaine in the dregs of their old ſuperſtition, but if they doe, here is the portion which they are to expect, to bee tormented for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>Others more generally vnderſtand the breaking out of the Goſpell againe,<note place="margin">Bullinger. Fox. Forbs. Graſſerus.</note> after that all had beene corrupted by Popery, the light of which Goſpell breaking out ſhould extend as the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:12860:232"/>truth did at the firſt to all nations, becauſe ſome in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys ſhould be ſtirred vp to publiſh the ſame, although all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it not, no more than they did in the Apoſtles times car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the light forth at the firſt into all countries, for although many ſtill were idolaters, yet we heare the Apoſtle affirming,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.

               </p>
               <p>Amongſt all theſe differences, it is agreed in the maine thing, that the breaking out of the light of the truth, which now, by Gods grace, ſhineth in <hi>England, Scotland, Denmarke, &amp;c.</hi> is here figured out, oppoſite vnto which, is <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill labouring to hold men in the darkneſſe of Popiſh ſuperſtition. But touching the particular application of theſe figures, either as <hi>Brightman</hi> and <hi>Pareus</hi> doth to three diſtinct times, the laſt of which is not diſtinct, for from <hi>Luther, &amp;c.</hi> hath beene onely a continuation of thoſe happy beginnings, and therefore I doe not thinke, that according to that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Preachers of the truth are figured out. Neither doe I ſubſcribe to <hi>Napier,</hi> that the third Angell ſetteth forth the Preachers which ſhall be when the Pope is quite put downe, becauſe killing of the Saints is ſtill ſpoken of for not worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the beaſt, and they are comforted with the bleſſing that ſhall follow vpon ſuch a death. Nor yet doe I thinke, that generally onely the breaking out of the light is here ſet forth, but becauſe here are three Angels ſucceeding one another in order, I hold that three things are here figured out, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught vs that liue in theſe dayes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the light of the truth ſhould breake out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men ſhould be warned againſt Popiſh idolatry and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it did by <hi>Wickliffe</hi> firſt in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>England</hi> had firſt a Chriſtened King <hi>Lucius,</hi> ſo hauing the honour firſt to hold out the light diſpelling the miſts of Popiſh darkneſſe: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt contemporanean with <hi>Wickliffe</hi> were others mentioned before in other countreys alſo.</item>
                  <item>2. That the light ſhould ſhine ſo, as that the fog of Popery ſhould vaniſh in many countreys, and that the truth ſhould be ſo powerfully preached, that <hi>Babels</hi> wals ſhould bee ſhaken and ruined, which was done by <hi>Luther</hi> and the reſt of the Worthies in diuers countreys before ſpoken of.</item>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:12860:233"/>
                  <item>3. That the vtter fall of the Pope ſhould yet after this bee deferred, he continuing ſtil where his power yet remaineth to kill and deſtroy his oppoſites. For why elſe ſhould the third Angell ſo ſeriouſly admoniſh men not to worſhip the beaſt, &amp;c. adding,<note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>here is the patience of the Saints,</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> but onely becauſe the ſeruants of God in many places ſhould ſtill bee exerciſed with bloudy perſecution after the fall of <hi>Babel</hi> before ſpoken of in a great part. So things are like to continue in this ſtate a long time, onely the comfort is, that wee are hence aſſured, that there ſhall bee Preachers to giue warning againſt the Pope and all falſe religions till the laſt comming of Chriſt vnto iudgment, and hereby he ſhall be conſumed more and more, till the date of this time ſhall be quite out.</item>

The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell which he bringeth,<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> is called the eternall Goſpell, to meet with the imputation of the Papiſts, who challenged them for broaching a new religion, when as indeed, they preached no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the eternall truth of God which was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. There was not long before this,<note place="margin">Cent. Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> a certaine fellow called <hi>Cyril</hi> a <hi>Carmelite</hi> Fryer, who made a booke, which hee intituled <hi>The eternall Goſpell,</hi> grounding vpon this place, and the religious of thoſe times readily receiued it, becauſe it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the maintenance of their ſuperſtitions, affirming that the Goſpell ſet forth by the Apoſtles was at an end, and this was now to take place. A moſt blaſphemous tenent, when as this our Goſpel is ſaid to be ſuch, that if an Angel from heauen bring any other,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> he is to be counted accurſed. It is none other Goſpell therefore which is here meant, but this only Goſpell, which being obſcured by the vaile of an vnknowne tongue, and by falſe Gloſſes and interpretations in the time of Popery,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:12860:233"/>is now come to light againe; and that not in a corner, but in all countreys and nations of Chriſtendome, and ſhall, wee doubt not, be diffuſed into all other parts ere long.

The chiefe thing therefore now to be preſſed, is to feare God and to worſhip him, by giuing ouer that fond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the Pope, whereby they were drawne after him, truſting in him, and receiuing his Dictates as the Oracles of a God, which indeed is the worſhipping of him. And the phraſe here vſed, <hi>giue glory to God,</hi> doth fitly anſwer that in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.13. where it is ſaid, that the great city being fallen, and ſeuen thouſand ſlaine, the reſt trembling gaue glory to God, that is, were conuerted from that ſuperſtition. <hi>The time of his iudgment is come,</hi> that is, is at hand, ſo that wee may gather hence, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. where after the open booke appearing, the Angell ſweareth that time ſhall be no more, &amp;c. that now ſince theſe things haue come to paſſe, the deſtruction of the Pope, and Papacy, and of all wicked ones is very neere, euen at the doores.</p>

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:12860:234"/>heathen <hi>Rome.</hi> Laſtly, becauſe this <hi>Babylon</hi> is afterwards cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The great Whoore,</hi> noting a ſtate apoſtatizing from the truth ſometime receiued, to goe after Idols: for in the holy Scriptures <hi>Iſrael</hi> only and <hi>Iudah</hi> are taxed for whoredome and not either Countries, becauſe they were married as it were vnto the Lord, and yet they fell from him to the ſeruing of Idols. Other Nations which were neuer taken in for Gods peculiar, though they were full of Idols, could not properly be ſaid to goe a whooring, no more could heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Popiſh ſtate now iuling there may juſtly be thus char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. <hi>Ribera</hi> ſeeing that it is but a ſhift to apply this to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Rome,</hi> at the laſt leaueth it and ſaith, That <hi>Rome</hi> is meant as it ſhall be, when in the time of Antichriſt it ſhall forſake the Pope and the Catholike Religion as he laboureth to make it probable that it ſhall doe.

               <p>To <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, and to the Pope who hath his ſeat there, all circumſtances doe ſo agree, as that we are ſure this Propheſie thus taken is already verified, a ſtate falling from the Pope there and returning to their old heathen idolatry is but a phantaſma, like the man in the Moone, which none but fooles will beleeue to be ſo indeed. Here is now the Empire ouer Kingdomes and Nations, here are miracles and ſhewes that draw the world after the Pope. After a long time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion by faire pretences, the eternall Goſpell is come to light againe, and this ſtate hath beene much ſhaken this thouſand yeeres and vpward, and is in a great part fallen, but yet murthereth and deſtroyeth the Saints according to their old manner; from hence are idolatries and ſuperſtitions deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into all Countries, and laſtly now ſtandeth that reuiued head which was deadly wounded being the ſeuenth, which was to come after Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time, for of the ſeuen fiue were fallen, one that is Emperours then ſtood, and the ſeuenth, that is the Pope, was to come. And the Ieſuite in yeelding that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall away to heathen idolatry from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion doth quite forget himſelfe of that grand Maxim, that the Church cannot erre, and is alwaies viſible; whereas if this ſhould befall the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:12860:235"/>hold to be the onely Catholike Church, it ſhould both erre fowly, and the Church ſhould ſometime be ouerthrowne by the gates of Hell and put downe from the viſibility; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch contradictions doe they plunge themſelues that are contradictors of the plaine and euident truth of Gods Word.</p>

And the diſtance of the place where the bloud out of the Wine-preſſe ouer flowed being 1600. furlongs doth notably agree, for in our Engliſh miles this is two hundred, for although the length of <hi>England</hi> be three hundred miles, yet one hundred in reſpect of the coldneſſe and barrenneſſe may well be cut off, as where there was no ſuch great Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of religious perſons, who ſtill gathered to the fatteſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the land. I cannot approue of any of theſe expoſitions, becauſe not particular iudgements but the generall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which at laſt ſhall be executed vpon <hi>Babylon</hi> is here figured out, vnto which alſo all the circumſtances may be very well fitted, as by and by ſhall bee ſhewed. And where any thing in words agreeing with the generall current of the holy Scriptures may well beare a ſutable interpretation, it is but curioſity to inuent ſingular interpretations. <hi>Brightman</hi> hath beene much taxed for his making one like the Sonne of man comming vpon a cloud to be an earthly Prince, neither doth that of his touching <hi>Cranmer</hi> agree, ouer whom the fire did rather preuaile than he ouer the fire, in that for feare he recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a time, though afterwards hee conſtantly ſuffered mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, to ſay nothing of the hundred miles more in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> than the ſpace here ſet forth, which in vaine he ſeeketh to reconcile.</p>
               <p>Others that are for the laſt iudgement of <hi>Babylon</hi> when Chriſt ſhall come at the end of the world, expound theſe things diuers waies.

               <p>I thinke it to be without doubt, that Chriſts comming to iudgement is meant by one vpon a white Cloud like the Sonne of man, and ſpecially againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe caſe more particularly is acted here: for <hi>Fox</hi> affirmeth that this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly held by all without contradiction till his time.<note place="margin">Act. 1.

Bullinger</hi> ſeemeth to me moſt rightly to reſolue it that this is ſpoken parabollically,<note place="margin">Bullinger.</note> wherein all things are not to bee ſtreined, but only the ſcope to be reſpected, and ſo an Angell is brought in telling him that the harueſt is ripe; as if a mans ſeruant comming out of the Corne field, ſhould tell him it is time to ſet on workemen to cut downe his Corne, for it is ripe and beginneth to ſhed in the field: and if any man will needs goe further in expounding all particulars here,<note place="margin">Fox.</note> that of <hi>Fox</hi> is the moſt probable, that hereby is ſet forth that the particular appointing of this time is at the will of the father, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when hee declareth himſelfe hee is wont to doe it by ſending an Angell, is ſaid to ſend out from his preſence an Angell here, for he commeth out of the Temple, a fit type of Gods preſence.</p>
               <p>Touching the other Angel comming out of the Temple alſo with a ſharp ſickle,<note place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> I aſſent vnto them that hold the ſame thing to be the ſecond time hereby repreſented, for the more ample declaration of the proceedings w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhall be at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a thing not vnuſual in the holy ſcriptures, &amp; particularly in <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.13. whereto it is alluded here. It is intimated therfore by this double deſcription, that as men doe in the time of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, and in the Vintage time, they cut down their Corne, they cut their Grapes, ſo all the people of the earth ſhal be cut down at the laſt day. Now whereas amongſt them ſome are good &amp; ſome bad, it is left to be ſought out elſewhere what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the good, and according to the ſcope of this place, which is to terrifie the wicked adherers to the Whoore of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> the proceedings againſt them only are deſcribed, they ſhall be cut downe as the Corne in the time of harueſt, and as the Grapes in the Vintage time, that is, they ſhall be deſtroyed from out of this world, neither ſhall that be all, but after this they ſhall be caſt into the Wine-preſſe of Gods wrath, there to be cruſhed and ſqueeſed in infinite multitudes an infinite long time, ſet forth by the bloud running out in ſo great
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:12860:238"/>abundance, arguing both many grapes and a long time of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. There is no ground by the reaping of the harueſt to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the gathering in of the godly as ſome would haue it taken, for Tares are amongſt the Corne, and this ſimilitude, howſoeuer it doth ſometime ſet forth the putting of an end to this temporall life in all men, yet ſometime with a particular reſpect vnto the wicked only as here, and <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.13. and then it is only to be ſo farre forth applied, as it ſetteth forth a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off or deſtroying from off the face of the earth, and if wee ſhall goe a little further in applying it, it muſt be in that which is vnderſtood, but in other places further added, <hi>viz.</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that part of the harueſt which is to be burnt with fire, the tares and the chaffe which it may be is alſo intimated here by the Angell which is ſaid to be ouer the fire, whoſe office haply it was when the other Angell had deſtroyed the world temporally to caſt the bundles of tares into vnquenchable fire, and the grapes which were ſharpe and ſowre into the Wine-preſſe of Gods wrath for euermore. And this Angell commeth from the Altar fitly, becauſe fire is vſually taken from thence for the deſtruction of the wicked, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.5. from whence haply he may be thus deſcribed, as afterwards hee that powreth out his Viall vpon the waters is ſaid immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the Angell of the waters, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.5. ſo this the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the fire or that had power ouer the fire. If any man ſhall further demand, but why doth not Chriſt appeare the ſecond time like the Sonne of man, but an Angell is ſaid to appeare, if both apparitions ſerue to expreſſe the ſame thing. I anſwer, that in the deſtruction of the world at the laſt day two things are to be conſidered, the Iudge by whoſe power and authority it ſhall be acted, and the inſtruments which ſhall be imployed herein; the firſt, is the Sonne of man, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Angels ſpoken of as one here, to ſhew their going about this miniſtery as one, and according to this twofold conſideration there are two diuers appearances of the Sonne of man ſitting and crowned, and of an Angell neither ſitting nor crowned, whereby wee are to vnderſtand the Lord and Maſter of this great Harueſt and Vintage is Chriſt Ieſus, hee onely giueth power to cut downe, and a fruit of his iuſt
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:12860:238"/>wrath is the wickeds ſuffering of endleſſe torments: but hee doth inſtrumentally act both the one iudgement and the other by his holy Angels, the ſentence giuing is omitted here, the iuſt manner of the whole proceeding at that day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently declared elſewhere. He ſhall come in a Cloud hauing a ſharpe ſickle in his hand, that is, being ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the wicked world and to cut them off with the breath of his mouth as with a ſharpe ſickle, then the Angels with all readineſſe as his Miniſters ſhall deſtroy the world, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſentence by him giuen leauing the godly who are inuited into the Kingdome of Heauen, they ſhall caſt the wicked into their place of torment in innumerable multitudes. And thus I thinke that all hitherto is made moſt plaine. There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth only the ſpace of ground without the City where the Wine-preſſe is trodden, being 1600. furlongs to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: touching which, I finde that moſt Expoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Touching the Angell of the fire, I doe not thinke with ſome, that either here or <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. where the Angell of the waters is ſpoken of, it can be iuſtly gathered that diuers things are aſſigned to diuers Angels to rule ouer, for they together are miniſtring Spirits to execute the will of God, ſometime in one kinde, and ſometime in another; and becauſe this Angell before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.5. is ſaid to take a Cenſer full of fiery coales from the Altar, he may now be brought in by this Periphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, tacitly implying what ſhall become of the harueſt of the wicked before ſaid to be reaped, and hee that afterwards is called the Angell of the waters, is plainly ſo called becauſe he powred out his Viall vpon the waters.</p>

Some referre this viſion to the tune after Antichriſts diſcouery, holding that it is here ſet forth by what degrees hee ſhould be brought downe vntill his finall vtter deſtruction. And laſtly, ſome doe make theſe ſeuen Vials parallel to the ſeuen Trumpets, and ſo to ſet forth the iudgements of God againſt perſecutors in all ages ſince the firſt propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. This laſt is coincident almoſt with the third, touching Preachers denouncing Gods iudgements in the ſeuerall ages of the Goſpell, neither of which can ſtand here, becauſe theſe are the laſt effects of Gods anger in this booke reucaled, and ſo neceſſarily after all the iudgements before figured out any
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:12860:240"/>kinde of way. As for that of <hi>Lyra,</hi> it is not worth the refuting, becauſe ſo theſe iudgements ſhould all haue beene executed long agoe, when it is plaine here that they hold to the end of the world. And that of their taking effect in the ſuppoſed three yeeres and an halfe of Antichriſts reigne is moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, becauſe if in ſuch a time according to the letter theſe things ſhould be ſenſibly fulfilled, it were eaſie for euery man to know Antichriſt, and when the day of iudgement ſhall be, which are both very great myſteries.

A Sea of pure water tranſparent like Cryſtall, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth holineſſe and immunity from corruptions in the midſt of the Antichriſtian ſtate. Hereupon the faithfull are ſet forth ſtanding, becauſe they abide ſtill in the pure worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, but this their purity is not without the mixture of fire through aduerſity for the cauſe thereof, for to fire are ſufferings here compared by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.22.</note> whereas he biddeth vs not to thinke ſtrange of the fiery triall.

How the world may bee figured out by ſuch a cleare water, ſeeing it is ſo miery and corrupt, I cannot ſee. Touching the fire mingled, if it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the holy Ghoſt, here were nothing but purity to purity, which is vnlikely; if contentions amongſt the faithfull themſelues, they ſhould not at the ſame inſtant haue beene brought in in ſo ſweet an harmony of praiſing God: but by fire vnderſtanding affliction, the eſtate of the godly euen in theſe times wherein Antichriſt is going downe, is moſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly ſet out, they are not yet in their reformed ſeruing of God without all mixture of the fire of perſecution, but are as it were vpon a glaſſie Sea mingled with fire. They are ſaid to haue ouercome the beaſt and his Image, &amp;c. becauſe they haue preuailed about the reformation of Religion by an high hand, ſetting vp the ſame againſt the machinations of the beaſt, his image, character, or number of his name. The harpes of God which they haue, ſeeme to haue reference to that which was ſpoken of Harpers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. they heard the Harpers in Heauen then and learned their ſong, now they ſing it playing as they did. And all this is ſaid to be done in Heauen, becauſe the godly by faith are in Heauen in minde, though in body they be in this world. The ſong which was
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:12860:241"/>onely mentioned before, is here more particularly declared to be the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a moſt fit ſong for ſuch as precaile againſt the beaſt, for in that ſong <hi>Moſes</hi> and the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> praiſed God for their deliuerance from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> and for executing iudgement vpon him in the red Sea, wherein his might did wonderfully appeare: ſo likewiſe the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indangered by this beaſt, but the victory being obtained through God inabling her, though ſhee cannot yet ſtand vpon the Sea banke, but in the Sea mingled with fire, yet for her deliuerance in part obtained, and fully by faith expected to be ere long, with Harpe and ſong ſhe praiſeth God as <hi>Moſes</hi> then did. And it is called the ſong of the Lambe alſo, becauſe containing his praiſes, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.9.

The 5, 6, 7.10, and 11. expoſitions then remaine, which in many things agree well together, and therefore by the light and help hereof I will endeuour, chiefly looking vp to the Father of lights for direction, to ſet downe the trueſt and moſt genuine ſenſe of theſe moſt myſticall vials.</p>

               <p>Touching the firſt Angell with his viall,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Angell,</hi>
                  </note> I cannot with <hi>Brightman</hi> vnderſtand it of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> becauſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe was an excellent inſtrument for the comfort of the godly and the vexation of the Popiſh, yet ſhe was not the firſt, as this Angell is. I hold therefore with <hi>Forbs</hi> and <hi>Pareus,</hi> that
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:12860:248"/>the firſt oppugners of Popery ſhewing their filthy byles, to their great vexation are here figured out; &amp; here we may aſcend higher than <hi>Luther,</hi> euen to <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and to the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albingenſes</hi> before, together with many Worthies, who wrote and ſpake againſt the filthineſſe of the Prieſts, Monkes, and Fryers many yeeres agone, as all that are but meanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in hiſtory know. And herein, as in almoſt all the reſt, it is alluded vnto the inchanters in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who were ſmitten with a ſore byle, that they could not ſtand before <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> for as theſe make men loathſome, ſo the abominable vices of the Roman Clergy made them loathſome to moſt men.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Angell.</hi>
                  </note> I doe not thinke, that the doctrine and Doctors of that Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> are meant: for ſo the ſpeech of the Angels iuſtifying the Lord in his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, giuing them bloud to drinke, as they had ſhed the bloud of the Saints, would not ſo well agree: for here is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted a paying of them with the like to that which they had done. I approue therefore here rather the tenth expoſition, that hereby is figured out the bloud of the Popiſh, ſhed by the Turkes eſpecially, and the order of time doth agree moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently; for after that the bloud of many thouſands of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents had beene ſhed in <hi>Merindall,</hi> and <hi>Cabriers,</hi> and other neighbouring parts for religion, a great deſtruction happened to the Papals by the Turkes,<note place="margin">Munſter. Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr. de Turcis.</note> about <hi>ann.</hi> 1444. <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> the Emperour himſelfe being ſlaine, together with many Princes, Dukes and Nobles, and an infinite multitude of common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Tranſiluania</hi> ſtill after this, the Turke preuailing many yeeres, a ſea of bloud was ſhed. As for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, I take it not to bee amiſſe to apply their turning into bloud, to executions done vpon Prieſts and Ieſuites for their treaſons here in <hi>England,</hi> and vpon Ieſuites in other parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the apparant iudgements of God vpon many of them that haue beene moſt forward in perſecuting to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the ſlaughters that haue beene made of them in their ciuill warres procured by their owne ſeeking.</p>
               <p>Touching the fourth, I hold that the increaſe of the light of the Goſpell is hereby ſet forth,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Angell.</hi>
                  </note> as moſt of my Authors agree,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:12860:248"/>for the word of God is compared to the Sunne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. which as it enlightneth, and ſo is comfortable, ſo it heateth; and the neerer it draweth to any part of the world, the more it ſcorcheth with the exceeding great heat thereof. And thus this viall doth very well agree to the euent, for the Sunne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen to enlighten the world, gat vp higher ſtill dayly in the firmament, till the heat of it grew intolerable to the Papals, making them to raile and ſweare againſt it like mad men.</p>
               <p>Touching the fift, there cannot be a more kindly expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than to apply it to the obſcuring of the Popes glory:<note place="margin">5. <hi>Angell.</hi>
                  </note> for when by the Sun-ſhine of the truth, the Doctors of that Church, and others who ſtand to the defence of it, are ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſo, as that they cannot maintaine with any reaſon any longer the Popes vſurped Supremacy, infallibility of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, indulgentiary power, and power to make Lawes, and to diſpenſe with Lawes, but their onely refuge is railing, and virulency of tongue, then what muſt needs follow next, but a vilipending of their Pope, whom they ſo much magnified? And when this commeth to paſſe, how can they that are the Popes vaſſals, and in their mindes inthralled to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but ſorrow extremely, and behaue themſelues like fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes?</p>
               <p>Touching the ſixt, I cannot thinke that the conuerſion and returne of the Iewes is once glanced at herein,<note place="margin">6. <hi>Angell.</hi>
                  </note> ſeeing that not by them, but by the Weſterne Kings, who ſet vp the Whore, ſhe muſt be made deſolate againe, as is plainly ſhewed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.16. and it were ſtrange, that ſuch a poore runnagate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the Iewes ſhould haue the title of Kings of the Eaſt, where they are the baſeſt and of the leaſt account. I ſubſcribe therefore to them that expound it as altogether Allegoricall, by <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the reuenues of the Popedome being meant, and by the Kings of the Eaſt, ſuch Kings as God would ſtirre vp in theſe parts to be her vtter ruine and ouerthrow, the great defence which is in the riuer of worldly wealth being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as ſometime <hi>Euphrates</hi> was dreaned, whereby <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken by <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> Eaſterne Kings. And becauſe the wealth of <hi>Spaine</hi> is ſo great a meanes to ſtrengthen this kingdome, yet I thinke it not amiſſe to bring that in alſo
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:12860:249"/>within the compaſſe of this great riuer. In that part where the Popes reuenues runne the water is very ſhallow at this day, &amp; there is great probability that the other will be much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſhortly, if not cleane dryed vp, if the Indian treaſure be once cut off, which is very powerfully attempted. And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I thinke, that theſe vials haue taken effect for the moſt part already, onely we are to expect the drying vp of this <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> more and more; and then that ſuch Kings and Princes as abominate <hi>Rome</hi> for the wickedneſſe therof, ſhould vniting their forces, giue the on-ſet vnto her deſolation.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſeuenth Angell, I hold it beſt to go with the common ſtreame of them that expound this of the finall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">7. <hi>Angell.</hi>
                  </note> not only of the beaſt and his followers, but of the whole world, that of the beaſt being againe re-aſſumed to bee more fully declared in the Chapters following, as being the moſt remarkable thing pointed at in this booke. For without wreſting and ſtraining the paſſages here in ſuch manner, as that there is no preſident for it in other places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it cannot be applied otherwiſe. <hi>It is done, Babylon came into remembrance to giue vnto her the cup of the wine of the fierceneſſe of Gods wrath, and euery Iland fled away, and the mountaines were no more found.</hi> What elſe can theſe ſpeeches ſet forth, but the full and finall recompencing of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of others enemies of the truth, which cannot be ſaid to haue beene done but at the laſt day? For then onely it may be rightly ſpoken, <hi>it is done,</hi> it being till then but in doing, and it is at that time onely that there is flying away to hide themſelues from the wrath of God, and that the faſhion of the world is altered. It ſhould ſeeme to make againſt it, that the great city is not ſaid to fall,<note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> but to be diuided into three parts. I anſwer with <hi>Pareus,</hi> that hereby the vtter ruine of it is ſet forth, ſeeing three parts, which may well be taken for all the parts of a building, are ſaid to be diuided or rent in ſunder, and in ſpeaking of three, it is alluded to the three before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, as the founders of this city; the Dragon, the beaſt, and the falſe prophet, &amp; the three vncleane ſpirits, like frogs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of their mouthes. Againe the nations are immediatly ſaid to haue fallen, that is, to be quite ouerthrown, and therfore
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:12860:249"/>it is not likely but that the vtter ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> is meant alſo, though deliuered in a diuers phraſe. Or if by the great city we vnderſtand all the countries where the Chriſtian religion hath beene planted, as I haue expounded it before vpon <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. then the city of <hi>Rome</hi> is not ſo much meant, but the whole dominions of Turke and Pope, for it is likely that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed before, the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the defence thereof being dryed vp, yea it muſt needs bee ſo by reaſon of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation made by ſuch as haue had trafficke there for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of that city, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. which cannot be after the great day of iudgement. And if the great city bee thus taken, then by the nations, other countreys which are neither Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metane nor Popiſh are to be vnderſtood, which for their ſinnes ſhall come to ruine alſo, this being plainly ſet forth; and the fall of the city by a periphraſis taken from ſuch a fal as is by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, as <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> fell before the Romans by a triple faction therin, to which in particular it is to be thought that it is allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for ſo much as <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> trodden vnder foot by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, is a type of Chriſtendome vnder the dominion of Turke and Pope, as hath been ſhewed more at large vpon <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Verſ. 21.</note> If it ſhould ſeeme to make againſt this expoſition, that a great haile like talents is ſaid to follow after all this, whereupon men blaſpheme God, which, as <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, is not to bee thought ſhall be at the day of iudgement, becauſe all mouthes ſhall then be ſtopped, the generall ſilence of all arguing their conſent to the iuſtice of Gods proceedings, and none blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any more; I anſwer with <hi>Pareus</hi> againe, that howſoeuer the wicked ſhall ſubſcribe to this iudgement in their owne conſcience as moſt iuſt, and ſo ſhall not mutter any word of reaſon againſt thoſe proceedings, yet the ſenſe of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of torment, from which they ſhall deſpaire euer to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, will ſo inrage them,<note place="margin">Exod. 6.</note> as that like the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> when haile &amp; fire mingled therwith came down from heauen, or like the Canaanites, vpon whom God hailed with exceeding great haileſtones, to the deſtroying of moſt of them, to which I think it is rather than to the other alluded here, as they, I ſay, being moued with anguiſh did doubtleſſe bitterly take on againſt the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo here the wicked at the laſt day are brought
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:12860:250"/>in blaſpheming to expreſſe the ſenſe of intolerable pangs, vpon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wicked men are wont thus to do. And haply their tongues will thus rebell againſt God, as the tongues of perſons inraged euerlaſtingly. Theſe things being thus explained, wee ſee that there is no reaſon why any ſhould be offended, and doubt whether Popery ſhall euer goe downe altogether or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſtill vpheld after ſo many yeeres ſince it firſt receiued a blow: for it muſt fall by degrees as it roſe by degrees; and as it had a long time of riſing to the full height, ſo it muſt bee long in falling into vtter deſtruction. And ſeeing fiue of theſe Vials haue ſo manifeſtly taken effect already, and the ſixt in a great part, why ſhould wee not by faith aſſuredly expect the full accompliſhment of it, as well as wee ſee the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe foregoing by experience. O yee fooliſh and blinde Papiſts, why are ye ſo hard to beleeue the things that this Prophet hath foretold touching your <hi>Babylon?</hi> if ye loue your ſoules, open your eyes, and by that which hath beene hitherto done be aſſured of a full deſtruction, and therefore come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> in time, and be not led hood-winked into ineuitable perdition.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is agreed that theſe foule ſpirits are inſtruments of the Pope, who come as it were out of his mouth, becauſe ſo like vnto him both in the ſame end which they aime at, and the meanes to effect it, lying ſignes and wonders; and more particularly I hold them to be none other but the Ieſuites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time of their beginning by <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> within theſe threeſcore yeeres doth notably agree, and their leaping vp and downe in Kings Courts, they being the greateſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts that the Pope hath for him to maintaine his credit with the Kings of the earth, that his reuenues may be no more dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: neither doe their practiſes to ſtirre vp to warre againſt Heretikes, vniuſtly ſo called, diſagree; for they are knowne to be the very firebrands of diſſentions, tumults, treaſons, and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:12860:250"/>bloudſheds thorowout all Chriſtendome euer ſince they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to be. They are ſaid to be three, when as indeed they are many thouſands, to note out their triple originall from the Dragon, who is the Deuill, the Beaſt, the Roman State which they trauell for, and the falſe prophet, the Pope (who before was called the ſecond beaſt, and not till now a falſe prophet, but here more fully declared by his name, as there by his pſeudopropheticall practiſes) whoſe eldeſt ſonnes they are, bending themſelues vp to the higheſt ſtreine of wit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for the ſupporting of his tottering chaire. Theſe ſtirre vp popiſh Kings and Princes ſo, as that they enter into leagues and vnions to root out poore Proteſtants. But ſilly men that they are, whilſt they are thus buſie for the benefit of the Popedome, little doe they thinke of him that ſitteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue and laugheth them to ſcorne, for that the ioyning of popiſh Princes together to root out the truth, ſhall by him bee turned to a gathering together to be deſtroyed, ſo as that they ſhall neuer be able to make head againe.

                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:12860:254"/>All this then is ſpoken of the Pope with his imperiall power, declaring the order and manner of the comming on thereof.

This expoſition of all others ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me to diſagree moſt with the Text: Firſt, becauſe the hornes of the beaſt are of the beaſt, and certainly limbs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, ſuch as God forbid that we ſhould count theſe godly Emperours. Secondly, becauſe theſe Emperours did neither receiue their Kingdome, which argueth a thing newly ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and that was not before, neither were they all at one houre, for they ſucceded one another in ſundry yeeres. Thirdly, becauſe the ſame ten which giue honour to the beaſt ſhall at the laſt deſtroy her, which cannot poſſibly be applied vnto them who did euer onely ſtand to her and defend her, if the Pope be counted the beaſt in their times. Neither can I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue of a certaine number put here for an vncertaine, becauſe howſoeuer ten may be thus put elſewhere, yet here about the heads and hornes of the beaſt the ſpirit is more punctuall, for the ſeuen heads it is agreed, and why ſhould another kinde of expoſition then be giuen of the ten hornes? Preciſely ten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are doubtleſſe meant, and not ſo much Kings as King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, being taken with the ſucceſſion of the Kings reigning therein, and of theſe Kingdomes I doe not thinke <hi>Lumbardy</hi> to be any, or any Kingdome ſpringing vp at the diſſolution of the Empire to endure a ſhort time onely, but ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:12860:255"/>as then deliuering themſelues from the Imperiall yoke, haue ſtood and ſhall ſtand free till the ruine of the Pope.

Their receiuing of power at one houre with the beaſt is not ſo ſtrictly to be taken as it ſoundeth, for by an houre in Scripture, ſomtime a compaſſe of times conſiſting of many yeeres is to be vnderſtood; thus the time of the Goſpell is called the laſt houre, and the ſame houre here is much about the ſame time 100. yeeres before or after or ſomewhat more; and if it be thus taken, the euent doth notably agree, the ſpringing vp of theſe Kingdomes being out of the ruines of the Empire, about <hi>ann.

It is to bee vnderſtood that the things here ſet downe follow in order that which was declared of the Kings making <hi>Rome</hi> and the Pope deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in the former Chapter. For after this great deſolation and deſtruction it is here ſhewed, that it ſhall continue ſo, neuer to be built vp or inhabited againe, for foule ſpirits and vncleane
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:12860:256"/>birds are wont to keep in deſolate and forſaken places, happily that men might be the leſſe troubled with them,<note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> and that by the horrour of ſuch places there might be the more liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of hells horrour.<note place="margin">Ribera.</note> 
                  <hi>Ribera</hi> yeeldeth a double rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of euill ſpirits being in deſolate places, one before Chriſts Incarnation, that through feare ſuch as paſſe by might bee drawne to idolatry, the other, after that monaſticall perſons might be terrifyed from reparing to deſolate &amp; ſolitary places. But this laſt ſauoreth of ſuperſtition, wherunto they that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, are ready to receiue any reaſon for good tending to the confirmation thereof, but I ſhould thinke rather, if for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards Monks they keep in ſuch places, it is becauſe they loue their ſociety being the fitteſt company for them,<note place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> ſeeing they haue abandoned the ſociety of men. The Angell that tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of this deſolation is wonderfully glorious to ſet forth the more the glory of God who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Angels ſerue.<note place="margin">Verſ. 4.

As they are pronounced bleſſed that ſhall take the children of <hi>Babylon</hi> and daſh their braines againſt the ſtones.

A true Chriſtian may finde more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at the hand of a Turke or Barbarian than amongſt the Roman Catholikes: for they are more bent againſt ſuch than againſt Iewes and Infidels, nothing but their bloud will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie if they be found out within any of the Popes dominions.

               <p>Some conceiuing a little otherwiſe of this paſſage,<note place="margin">Brightman.

For they ſay that <hi>Rome</hi> being deſtroyed, the Pope ſhall reſide a certaine time at ſome other place, as at <hi>Auinion</hi> or ſome other, but not about fiue and forty yeeres, which time being expired, the vnfortunate battell in <hi>Harmageddon</hi> ſhall bee fought, where all the Pontifician forces and the Pope alſo being quite ouerthrowne, the Orthodox ſhall prey vpon their lands and houſes, and poſſeſſe them from thence forward to the end. And whereas two diuers puniſhments, of fire and brimſtone for the Pope, and being ſlaine with the ſword for his followers are mentioned, they vnderſtand them both of temporall iudgments, the one of the Pope, being ſo ſet forth as moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous according to the exceſſe of his ſin aboue all others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many ſhall yet at the laſt turne and ſubmit themſelues to the truth.

All this time they ſay, Satan is bound vp from deceiuing the Gentiles, becauſe their idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition falleth before the Goſpell euery where. Some hold, that preciſely a thouſand yeeres are here meant, but they differ much about the beginning of this time. Some ſet downe three remarkable times, holding that it is indifferent to begin it at one of them. 1.

For till then, howſoeuer Satan had not that liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, by meanes of the Goſpell, yet he ſeduced ſtill the Kings and Princes and great ones of the earth, which being the heads of the reſt, and drawing a world of people after them, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill cannot well be counted to haue beene ſhut vp from the deceiuing of the Gentiles, till that they, or the moſt of them being enlightened by the truth, abandoned idolatry, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came embracers of the holy Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. And if we begin this time then at <hi>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Deuill was then plainly ſhut vp, when the Temples of idols were ſhut vp, and the true Religion was commanded to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued euery where, hindring him from deceiuing the world any more, as formerly he hath done. And he had his priſon ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to him againe, when the Turke brake in vpon the Eaſterne Empire, wanne <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and made it the ſeat of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſeeking to draw the world of people, which came vnder his iuriſdiction from Chriſt vnto the impoſtour <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:12860:264"/>which was <hi>ann.</hi> 1300. And when corruptions in the Church being long in hatching were growne to that height, that they which were ſeduced by them, might as well be counted to be deceiued by the Deuill, as the Gentiles of old were, ſeeing the like idolatries with images, Maſſes and Crucifixes were daily committed, and a Queene of heauen was alſo ſet vp, the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> which was alſo about the ſame time, as I haue ſhewed more at large in my booke called <hi>An Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, pag.</hi> 66. Since that time the Deuill hath noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly raged againe by the Turkes in the Eaſt, and the Pope in the Weſt, but for our comfort it is called but a ſhort time, wherein they ſhall thus proceed, and then by the finall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhall all be cut off, and receiue according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. It is not to be taken for a ſhort time according to man, but according to the diuine phraſe directed thus for conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it being indeed but a ſhort time with the Lord, though in our account it be long, 324. yeeres being already paſt ſince, and God knoweth how long this rage ſhall yet endure. If it be obiected, that it ſeemeth contradictory in it ſelfe to hold that the Deuill was impriſoned, and at the ſame time Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt his great Lieutenant was in the world, the Pope and Turke, it muſt be conſidered, that their beginnings were ſo ſlender, both of the Turke for want of that power, and of the Pope whoſe myſtery of iniquity was long in comming to a full height, as it ſeemed not good vnto the Spirit of God to point at their firſt beings, through the inſtigation of Satan, but at ſuch a ſtate, as wherein Satan might euidently appeare to haue broken out of hell againe, to abuſe the world, as hee did in the time of Heatheniſme.</p>

They vnderſtand this therefore of the glorified eſtate of the ſoules of the faithfull, who either ſuffered vnder the heathen Emperors, or in this time of a thouſand yeeres.

As a man may ſay of any family to which an eſtate hath remained from generation to generation fiue hundred yeeres, this hath beene their inheritance fiue hundred yeeres, though ſome of them came not to it till twenty or ten yeeres agone.

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:12860:265"/>of, are they that ſit in thrones, yet differ in the expoſition of this their ſitting, and liuing and reigning, for they apply all to liuing and reigning by grace, and cleaning to Chriſt in the acknowledgement and profeſſion of his truth: for this is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to liue and reigne with Chriſt, though outwardly they were poore, deſpiſed, and perſecuted, ſeeing by grace wee are made to ſit together in heauenly places; but withall, they ſay, that the flouriſhing eſtate of the Church is here ſet forth in this time, the Deuill being put downe in remouing the rule and dominion from Heathen to Chriſtian Emperours, in whoſe time the ſoules of ſuch as ſuffered in the dayes of the Heathen are ſaid to liue and reigne, becauſe they were honourably eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, and reuenge was now in ſome part taken vpon their aduerſaries. And of theſe, one in particular, <hi>viz. Brightman</hi> ſeemeth to hold, that the thouſand yeeres here ſpoken of, are a different time from the former thouſand yeeres, beginning ſoone after <hi>ann.</hi> 2300. for he ſaith, that of them three hundred yeeres are now expired. And <hi>Pareus</hi> maketh mention of ſome that held the ſame.</p>
               <p>Others expound this ſitting vpon thrones,<note place="margin">Aug. de Cin. Dei lib. 20. cap. 7. Dent.</note> of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the word of God, and Eccleſiaſticall Gouernours now being lifted vp, and exerciſing their diſcipline with authority.</p>
               <p>Others holding two ſeuerall things here ſet forth,<note place="margin">Napier.</note> expound the ſitting in thrones of the Popes dignity, in the dayes of Pope <hi>Silueſter, ann.</hi> 315. to whom <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great gaue the iudgement, when he ſet him vp ſo high, and his ſucceſſors after him: and the ſoules, the ſoules of ſuch as were by the Popes appointment afterwards put to death, <hi>viz.</hi> all true hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>They which ſtand for a different time from the thouſand yeeres ſpoken of before, are certainly in an errour, becauſe by all circumſtances in the Text, the time is all one. For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils being bound and looſed againe, is alſo here mentioned as the boundary of this time, as it was of the former. Moreouer, here were a ſtrange gap opened into an expectation of this world to laſt yet ſeuen hundred yeeres, which is againſt all probability.</p>
               <p>That expoſition which referreth the thrones to the Pope,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:12860:265"/>cannot ſtand in reaſon: for Satan being bound, it is not to bee thought that his Lieutenants, the Popes, aduancement ſhould be ſhewed, but rather the aduancement of ſuch as withſtood him. Neither can I ſubſcribe to that of the glorified eſtate of the Saints departed, vnto whom the reſt of the dead are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who liued not againe, till the thouſand yeeres expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: becauſe ſome viſible alteration is here doubtleſſe ſet forth at the binding of the Deuill, ſeeing otherwiſe the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Prophecy could not haue beene conceiued of by the faithfull vpon earth for their comfort, when as it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ſet forth for this end and purpoſe. And as for that expoſition, whereby theſe things are applied vnto the Prelates and Rulers of the Church, the deſcription of being ſet vpon thrones and hauing power of iudgement, is too glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to agree vnto them. Wherefore I preferre that of the ſenſible moſt happy alteration in the ſtate of the world, in the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great: for then thrones were ſet for Chriſtians, and they had the power of iudging, who before were iudged: and in this time the ſoules of the faithfull who had beene put to death for the Chriſtian religion in the time of perſecution, might well bee ſaid to liue and reigne with Chriſt, becauſe they had beene ſet forth as lying vnder the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and crying for reuenge vpon thoſe that ſhed their bloud, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. all the time that the Heathen reigned. And whoſoeuer worſhipped not the beaſt, as they departed out of this life, they had communion with them in this their erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all theſe thouſand yeres, that is, the body of the Saints being conſidered as one, but not euery particular member. For they all and euery of them liued and reigned in this time of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres, though ſome a longer, ſome a ſhorter part of it. Their liuing and reigning then here ſpoken of, muſt needs haue reference to their lying and crying before mentioned, and therefore as that was ſpoken of, to ſet forth times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution without any appearance of a deliuerer that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge that innocent bloud, ſo here is nothing elſe ſet forth, but a deliuerance of the Church, and a putting of power into the hands of the faithfull to reuenge themſelues vpon the heathen, as was ſometime giuen to the Iewes by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meanes of <hi>Heſter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſter 8.</note>
                  <pb n="510" facs="tcp:12860:266"/>and <hi>Mordecai.</hi> For although the ſoules of the faithfull did liue and reigne with Chriſt before, mmediatly after their ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the body, yet becauſe vnto perfect dominion it is not onely requiſite to be in glory and ioy with the Lord, but to haue our enemies beaten downe and deſtroyed, they are not ſaid to liue and reigne with the Lord till this accompliſhed. Touching the reſt of the dead, who are ſaid not to riſe againe till theſe thouſand yeeres ended, I cannot thinke that it is meant of the dead in ſinne and ſuperſtition, who riſe not till then, that is, neuer: becauſe they which were before ſpoken of, are corporally dead, for they were ſlaine; and theſe are plainly a part of them, for hee ſaith, <hi>the reſt of the dead,</hi> and therefore corporally dead alſo. I ſuppoſe then, that by the reſt of the dead, the innumerable company of them that haue died ſince the beginning of the world, are meant, the time of whoſe reſurrection is not to bee expected till after theſe thouſand yeeres, leſt when we heare of ſome liuing and reigning with Chriſt, and of thrones ſet, and the iudgement giuen, we ſhould imagine the generall reſurrection, and Chriſts comming to iudgement to be here meant.</p>

But it is to bee vnderſtood, that theſe words are metaphoricall and not proper, the riſing of the Church from vnder perſecution to ſuch an eſtate, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the truth is propagated with authority, is, as it were, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, and therefore is ſo called: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the life that vniuerſally came then into the world, by meanes of the Goſpell, thus propagated, it is called the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: as the conuerſion of the Iewes which ſhall be, is called by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.15.</note>

<pb n="511" facs="tcp:12860:266"/>bleſſed in this, that they rule and reigne, the world being now Chriſtian, and are not vnder the dominion of their enemies, neither ſhall the ſecond death ſeize vpon them, as vpon none elſe that are in the like condition, that is, by the power of the Goſpell and ſpirit raiſed vp from the death of ſinne to the life of righteouſneſſe. For of a bodily reſurrection it cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be vnderſtood, as I haue already proued, but being thus vnderſtood, all things will moſt excellently agree. <hi>I ſaw thrones ſet, and them that ſate vpon them, &amp;c.</hi> that is, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented vnto me, how in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, the faithfull ſhould begin to rule and reigne in this world. <hi>And I ſaw the ſoules, &amp;c.</hi> that is, and at that time it was ſhewed me by the altered condition of ſuch as had giuen their liues for the truth, who before were ſet forth as crying, but now as ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and reigning, in token of an end put to thoſe calamities, and a beginning made of proſperity, that the caſe of the Church was altered, and this laſted a thouſand yeeres. <hi>This is the firſt reſurrection, &amp;c.</hi> that is, this the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls being aduanced to rule and reigne here, being a meanes to conuert ſo many millions in all parts to the truth, is, as it were, a generall reſurrection going before that at the laſt day, againſt which they are well prepared that haue their part in this, by being quickened in grace, for the ſecond death ſhall neuer ſeize vpon ſuch: but they ſhall reigne with Chriſt a thouſand yeeres by the proſperous and flouriſhing eſtate which the Church enioyeth here, and afterwards for euer, by being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſſed of the kingdome of heauen in body and ſoule for euermore.</p>
               <p>Note,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that the onely way to be ſafe from euerlaſting deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in hell, is by making a reſurrection before the laſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that is, a reſurrection vnto grace, which is only when the Word doth powerfully operate in the heart to make a man come out of his ſinnes. For a man may liue in the time of this reſurrection, and yet not haue part in it, if after the manner of moſt men he contenteth himſelfe with an outward profeſſion and name of a Chriſtian, not caring to haue grace in his heart, whereby he may proue that he hath attained to a new life.</p>

               <p>Hauing thus ſet downe the diuers expoſitions which I find vpon this place, I come now by the helpe of them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. By the Deuill, I vnderſtand the Deuill properly, and not the Emperour of the Turkes, becauſe he is the Author of ſeducement to ſuch as are ſeduced, and he, not the Turke, was ſhut vp a thouſand yeeres: but now getting looſe, hee goeth out to deceiue the Nations in that wherein hee was hitherto reſtrained, <hi>viz.</hi> by idolatry and ſuperſtition, through the meanes of the Turke and Pope his chiefe inſtruments. For the idolatry of Popery and their ſuperſtition, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of the Turkes began to increaſe mightily about <hi>ann.</hi> 1300. Neither was this all that the Deuill laboured in, but that there might be none to oppoſe theſe things, he gathereth <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> together, whoſe number is as the ſand of the Sea-ſhore, that is, he ſtirreth vp the Pope a ſecret enemy in the Weſt, and the Turke an open enemy in the Eaſt, by fire and ſword to deſtroy the company of thoſe that ſtand for the truth, which howſoeuer it hath beene in a great part fulfilled already, yet the moſt remarkable time is to come, wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered together in greateſt multitudes, they ſhall be by the immediate hand of God deſtroyed as with fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſo that they ſhall neuer be able to make head againe, as was before ſet forth vnder the ſixt Viall,<note place="margin">Chap. 16.16.</note> by the place called <hi>Harmageddon,</hi> into which they ſhould bee gathered.

Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fire, and the caſting of the Deuill into the lake of fire and brimſtone, I cannot thinke it is to bee meant of the laſt iudgement, and of the fire of that great day of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when that day ſhall come, there ſhall be a generall ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eating and drinking, marrying and giuing in marriage, and not warring and ſighting, for if an end of theſe warres ſhould be made by the Lords comming to iudgement, how ſhould the faithfull haue time here to reioyce and to giue thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

But when they ſhall come in their greateſt power againſt the true Chriſtians of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, though the Papiſts ſhall ioyne with them to make their Armies innumerable, God will from Heauen fight againſt them and confound them. In confidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of let vs be reſolute, and comfort our ſelues, if we ſhould ſee greater preparations of warre made by all our enemies, for we ſhall vndoubtedly triumph ouer them all at the laſt.</p>

But the place is ſo plainly of the generall reſurrection at the laſt day, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ſo ſleighty to cauſe vs to vary from the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued expoſition, which is of the generall reſurrection, and the expoſition which applyeth it to the Iewes in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paſſages here is ſo wreſted and forced,<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> as one, a learned Writer hath well noted, as that this may by no meanes be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. The chiefe reaſon of this interpretation is drawne from that which followeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.22. becauſe the Authour of it conceiueth; that the deſcription of the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:12860:269"/>with the circumſtances cannot agree to the ſtate of the Church triumphant in heauen, and therefore a famous Church to come vpon earth muſt needs be pointed at there: but how theſe may be applied to the ſtate of the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in heauen ſhall appeare in their proper place. In the meane ſeaſon I follow the common expoſition of all Writers, holding that the generall reſurrection and proceedings which ſhall bee at the laſt day are here ſet forth: for euery place of Scripture is properly to be vnderſtood, vnleſſe there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of admitting a figure, becauſe otherwiſe either ſome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity will follow, or it will not agree with the analogy of faith, neither of which can be iuſtly ſaid here. He that ſitteth vpon a great white Throne is the Lord Ieſus, who appeareth thus to ſhew his glory, for white is a ſigne of glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.1. the heauen and earth are ſaid to fly away from before him, to declare the fierceneſſe and intolerableneſſe of his anger at that day, which is ſuch, that neither earth nor heauen are able to beare it, a circumſtance very vnfit to bee applied to that moſt notable worke of grace in bringing the Iewes home to the faith. They ſhall fly away in regard of their externall forme and figure, for they ſhall be changed as a veſture, the heauens melting with heat, and the earth flaming with fire, but their ſubſtance ſhall ſtill remaine after this called a new heauen and a new earth, as moſt hold. The dead that ſtand before the Iudge, are both great and ſmall, euery one riſing in that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of body, wherein he fell; againſt the Ieſuites conceit, that all ſhall be of ſuch a ſtature as one is ordinarily at his full age. The bookes that are opened, are according to ſome, the bookes of men conſciences, according to others, the bookes of holy Scripture, but according to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> both, which I thinke to be righteſt; for euery mans conſcience ſhall then be made manifeſt, whether it be good or euill, foule or cleare, and according to the bookes of holy Scripture all ſhall be iudged, as they haue receiued and obſerued the things therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or not.

<pb n="518" facs="tcp:12860:270"/>booke of life then is the booke of faith, for he in whomſoeuer a true faith is found ſhall then liue, the reſt ſhall be caſt into hell. I ſubſcribe to the booke of Predeſtination, for this of faith was ſpoken of before amongſt the bookes, and becauſe it is hidden from vs who are written in this Booke, God only knoweth that a thing well knowne to vs is further ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> Workes, euery man is iudged according to his workes, for good workes alwayes are in ſuch as bee written in this booke. It is not ſaid according to their faith, becauſe that is more latent, and there is more deceit in it, neither is it ſaid, for their workes, but <hi>all that were not found written in the booke of life,</hi> that is, that were not elected, <hi>are caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> but yet iuſtly, for their euill workes deſerue it: on the contrary ſide therefore, they which are ſaued, are ſuch as be written in the booke of life, here is the originall of their ſaluation, God hath elected them, and good reaſon there is, in reſpect of men, that they ſhould be ſaued, for their works haue beene good, whereas the workes of the reprobate haue beene euill, and to good workes God hath promiſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as he hath threatened iudgement to euill workes, yet in reſpect of God, there is no reaſon of merit in the beſt works, becauſe it is our duty to doe them, and being examined by the rule of Gods righteouſneſſe they are defectiue, when wee doe them in the beſt manner that we can; but there is good reaſon of merit of death in euill workes, becauſe vpon paine of death they are forbidden, ſo that he ſhall be well worthy to die that committeth them, euen as a murtherer or robber is worthy to be hanged; but on the other ſide, he that doth good workes is not well worthy of euerlaſting life, though it bee promiſed that he ſhall be thus rewarded, no more than a dutifull ſubiect is worthy for that ſeruice which his Prince commandeth him, and promiſeth to reward with the marriage of his daughter, and making him his ſonne, can be ſaid to be worthy of it. For it was of grace that his Prince made him ſuch a promiſe, to whom he ought that ſeruice without a reward, neither could it bee worthy of ſo great a reward, though greatly deſeruing, and therefore it came of grace, not of his merit. But if of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet there is a great diſproportion betwixt the ſeruice of
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:12860:270"/>any ſubiect to his Prince, and the actions of a Chriſtian to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: for the Prince doth meerely command and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his ſubiect with neceſſaries to doe that ſeruice which hee putteth him vpon, but it is his owne valour and wiſdome, whereby he performeth it without any inabling further from his Prince in the very doing: for notwithſtanding his furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, hee may as well miſcarry as effect that which hee goeth about. But God inableth his to that which he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>He worketh the will and the deed of his owne good pleaſure.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 2.13.</note> Againe, the greateſt reward of a Prince is but the reward of a man to a man, a temporany reward, and ſo happily the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that redoundeth to him by that ſeruice may be equall to the reward: but euerlaſting life, which is the reward of God, is farre more excellent than any thing that any man can doe, or the benefit hereby redounding vnto God which is none; for, <hi>If thou be righteous, thou art righteous for thy ſelfe,</hi>

                  <hi>if thou bee wicked, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.</hi> The Papiſts therefore, that from hence and from the like places ſeeke to eſtabliſh the merit of good workes, doe greatly ſtraine and force ſuch places againſt all ſenſe and reaſon.

For if hell ſhould bee meant as the word ſoundeth, then hell ſhould bee ſaid to bee caſt into hell, which cannot ſtand; if the heires of hell, then the ſame word ſhould be vſed in another ſenſe, as it were with the ſame breath; that is not likely, but being taken, as I haue ſaid, it doth well correſpond vnto the words before going, and the argument of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keds deſtruction, which onely is here ſet forth, is fitly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, the comforts of the faithfull being reſerued to be ſpoken of in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>This is a notable place to ſhew both the vniuerſality of the iudgement that ſhall be,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and the terribleneſſe of the Iudge to the wicked, ſo that nothing ſhall be able to abide his preſence, and the iuſt proceedings according to which all ſhall bee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, becauſe they ſhall be by bookes, and according to mens workes: and laſtly, the wofull eſtate of all that haue done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, after this time, they ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire, and the ioyfull eſtate of thoſe that haue done well, death and hell is aboliſhed vnto them, ſo that they ſhall ſtand in feare of theſe enemies no more.

They may indeed be rightly ſaid to bring their glory to the Church, when as they come in with their ſubiects to the embracing of the faith of Chriſt, but otherwiſe there can be no good expoſition of this paſſage.

                  <hi>Let him that is vniuſt be vniuſt ſtill, &amp;c.</hi> The common anſwer here is, that ſealing being vſed to keepe cloſe writings, that they may not be lookt into and read, the Lord would not haue this Prophecy ſealed, becauſe he would haue all his people to looke into it and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, as ſetting forth things which were ſhortly to begin to take effect. Whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> is commanded to ſeale vp his Prophecy,<note place="margin">Dan 12.4.</note> it was becauſe it ſhould bee a long time before it ſhould take effect, a certaine argument that Antichriſt being the chiefe ſubiect of this Prophecy, came long agoe, and is not ſtill to be expected.</p>
               <p>Touching the other words, <hi>Let him that is vniuſt be vniuſt ſtill, &amp;c.</hi> they are not ſpoken as intimating a leauing of euery one to the liberty of his owne will, as Popiſh Writers doe hence collect, but come aptly in here after the leauing of this Booke vnſealed mentioned.

Touching the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall particle <hi>[for]</hi> ſome omit it as redundant, but it is of great force to argue a neceſſity of attending to and reuerently regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what is here ſet forth. For that muſt needs be of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence which is guarded with ſuch a caution. If teſtimonies be alleaged onely to proue the truth of a thing, it doth not ſo much moue to conſider of it, but it being auerred to be ſuch, as that it is danger of death to depraue it any way, all men will beginne to attend vnto it as handling matter of life and death. And what is ſpoken of this Booke, by the like reaſon is well applyed by our Diuines to all Bookes of holy Scripture: for why is it ſo dangerous to take away or to adde vnto this Booke, but becauſe it is of God? And is it not as dangerous then to intermeddle in this kinde with any other of the Bookes of God, ſuch as all the Bookes of Scripture are. But it is well added to this as the laſt, as the charge of not putting to or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away from the Bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> is added in the laſt of his Bookes. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> excepteth againſt this inference,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> holding that the threatning pertaineth only to the detractors from or adders to this Booke, and neceſſarily, for otherwiſe, with what colour could they obtrude to the people of God vnwritten traditions as being of equall authority with the Word of God? How durſt they take away the Cup in the holy Communion, and the ſecond Commandement out of the Decalogue, and with ſuch audacity change our Lord in many places into our Lady, with many the like corruptions? With what face could they hold and maintaine that all things
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:12860:282"/>neceſſary to ſaluation are not ſet forth in the holy Scriptures, when as they are ſo compleat as that there may be no additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made vnto them? But this exception will doe them no good, when God ſhall iuſtifie his care to be a like tender ouer all other Bookes of Scripture as ouer this diuine Booke. And that theſe words may be certainly knowne to be the words of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Verſ. 20.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith for concluſion, <hi>Hee which teſtifieth theſe things ſaith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Euen ſo come Lord Ieſus.</hi> For whoſe comming that we may be the more fit, let vs acquaint our ſelues with the things herein contained, ſith they are left vnſealed to vs to this end and purpoſe, and being acquainted with theſe myſteries, which being explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (as through Gods aſſiſtance thou haſt them here preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto thee) doe ſo euidently ſhew the Pope to bee Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and his eſtate together with all that follow him to bee damnable, halt not betwixt two opinions, but bee a reſolute reformed Catholike, nothing doubting, but certainly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their finall ouerthrow and confuſion, and thine owne deliuerance and euerlaſting ſaluation: which let vs all pray with this our bleſſed Apoſtle, that it may come quickly. <hi>Amen.</hi>
